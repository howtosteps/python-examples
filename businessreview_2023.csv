"I am a kid who goes to Math Genie and its really fun.
You get to learn stuff that puts you way ahead in your grade level.
The teachers are really nice.
it is one of the best classes i have ever gone to."
"My daughter has been going to MathGenie in East Brunswick for about a month now.  She attends both Math and English classes.  she looks forward to the weekly 2-hour long classes, especially Ms. Ogar's abacus classes.  Ms. Ogar is able to have the kids ""love"" working on math problems, with passion!  it may sound exaggerating, but my daughter was return home from the 2 hour long session, and go straight to her desk, open her math genie backpack, work on the home work again.  I can tell she enjoying working on the workbooks from math genie, it's fun like playing for her."
"My daughter is doing better at her mad minutes because of math genie,YOU ARE THE BEST TEACHER IN THE WHOLE WORLD !!!!!!!!!!!"
It is a rewarding experience for our girls who thoroughly learn and enjoy every minute of their class.
"My son has been attending Math Genie for more than a year.
We have seen a tremendous improvement in his math. Ms. Olga is a wonderful teacher and has helped my son every step of the way. To sum how good my son is, he adds and subtracts 3 digit numbers mentally whereas we have to use a calculator."
My 5-and 7-year-old have been attending the Math Genie program since June 2013.  My 5-year-old is doing addition and subtraction on the abacus.  She is also able to perform mental operations easily.  My 7-year-old's mental aptitude has increased dramatically in the program.  He is able to use his abacus skills in his schoolwork and in word problems.  He can't wait to get to the multiplication and division!  I feel they are learning more than they would in their regular school curriculum and their understanding of numbers has increased from the program.
"I have looked into other popular math programs out there before deciding on Math Genie. What sets them apart is that their approach to learning math is both practical and fun. It encourages analytical thinking and develops problem solving skills. Math Genie helps their students become more focused in classwork and be more responsible with homework.

My son Joshua benefited tremendously from the program. He is in the Advanced Math class in his school and I'm sure Math Genie helped him achieve that. My other son Matthew just started with the program. I'm confident that it's just a matter of time that he will follow in his brother's footsteps, with the help of the wonderful teachers at Math Genie."
My daughter joined 3 weeks back and I have seen an increase in her speed using the abacus and she enjoys doing her homework
"Our 7 yr old daughter has been attending Math Genie in East Brunswick for over 9 months now.  It all started one day when she told me that she that other classmates where better than her at math.  I had heard about Math Genie before and decided to enroll her.  We are amazed at the high level of sustained enthusiasm our daughter has developed in learning mental math.  The teachers do an awesome job in presenting mental math with the Abacus system.  One thing I appreciate is the individual pace that each student progresses in.  If the student struggles in any area the teacher will reinforce the lesson in HW and the next lesson repeatedly until the concept is learned,  I also appreciate quick ""after class"" feedback that the teacher shares with each parent.  It helps parents know what areas the child needs help in to focus during the week."
"My daughter really loves Math Genie. There is much to learn that can be used in school. the teacher ,Ms Olga is a very good teacher ."
My daughter has been attending Math Genie for a year now. She looks forward to her math class every week and have progress steadily.  The most rewarding of it is seeing the proud look on her face when she completes her homework without mistakes.
"Math genie is a great place for the kids to be there. My son started when he was 5 and graduated recently. My daughter is going to math genie south plainfield for a year now and getting the confidence. it not only sharpens their math skills but much more for overall brain development. Great teachers , they are always open to feedback.
Do a  favor to yourself by enrolling your kids here to get to a great start!!"
"This is an excellent tutoring service for both Reading Skills and Math. It is a unique format of learning that improves the kids memory retention as well as increased focus.
Both of our kids have seen huge gains since joining Math Genie. And it is great to be a step ahead in the key skills of reading and math.
And it is not all about just study..the kids have fun and it is great to see that they have incorporated a short meditation before the classes. The kids come out from the classes excited and happy.
The teachers are great and very accommodating, understanding. And Mr. Mohit/Ms. Naina who run this tutoring service are always open to suggestions and very approachable."
"My 8-year-old and 6-year-old daughter both love Math Genie!  I enrolled my older daughter after she had been struggling with math at school in first grade, mostly out of a lack of confidence and interest.  Math Genie really did make math more fun for her and since she has begun, we have noticed a marked improvement in her math assessments at school and her overall attitude towards math in general.  We liked it so much, we enrolled my younger daughter who was in kindergarten at the time, even though she was not having any difficulties. Now she is performing far and above her grade level AND all her other subjects.  Best of all, they really do enjoy going and love their teachers."
"My Son loves Math Genie, Ms Olga makes math fun.
I’ve noticed an improvement in both concentration and
confidence is all area of life. It is amazing how he is
Able to quickly calculate, triple digit addition and
Subtraction mentally"
My 9 year old son has been attending Math Genie for few months and he is loving it. I have seen good improvement.  Ms. Olga is a fun teacher and my son likes being in her class.  He  is getting better in mental math now.
"The Math and Reading classes at Math Genie have been extremely beneficial for my kids.
The classes are very well structured. They focus on the foundational basics which stay with the kids throughout their academic growth.
The books and material provided are also of quality content. Great academic place for kids!"
My 9 year old son has been in the program for years. He has always been ahead of his classmates in school and among the highest scores in his class because of Math Genie. The people at Math Genie present math in way that makes learning fun for kids and the results are clear. I highly recommend this program to every parent.
"My daughter(Ghazal) has going to Math Genie for over a year now and she has improved incredibly over time. The teachers are great at addressing your concerns and working towards improving your child's skills. She has been with Ms. Tejal for the whole time,  who's an incredible teacher and has helped my daughter with her focus and concentration as well. We have tried several other programs but Math Genie seriously worked the way it promised. Also, the owners Naina and Mohit have always been there to address your concerns if any."
"My son has been with Math Genie since he's 4. He enjoys coming to the Genie Program and his teachers are very dedicated. They would usually provide good feedback after each class with regards to his progress . My son excels in his Math scores in all his school exam including end of the school year Math Test. I believe this program has equipped him with the foundation problem solving skills he needs as he embarks into a lifelong journey of learning and overcoming the challengers that comes with it . Of course, this is all done in a pace that is comfortable for him and he enjoys his classes very much!"
My son has been attending the Math Genie program for about 1 1/2 years now.  We started out in East Brunswick and have now moved to this new locatiohn.  My son is a very confident 8 year old boy.  So many of his classmates (now going into 3rd grade) are struggling with math while my son gets through it very easily.   I am happy to report that he scored a 39 out of 40 in the year end assessment test.  I attribute his success in math to Math Genie and would highly recommend this program.

Our son has been enrolled in Math Genie for one year and has shown a considerable improvement in his math skills.
"My children have been with Math Genie since my daughter started in 2008 and now my son is currently attending.  I have seen positive results in school for both children.  Often teachers commented on how strong their math skills were.  My son was recently picked to go to Enrichment class as the teacher noted 2nd grade math was too easy for him.  Mohit, Naina and the teachers are all out to help your child succeed.  I am truly pleased to have had found this school."
My 7.5 year old son has been attending the reading program for the last few months. It has improved his reading in school. Its a great school and I will recommend it anyone who wants their kids to improve. I have already recommended to many of my friends.
I would say that Math Genie's Reading Genie Program is fantastic because my son's progress in reading is remarkable and the teacher can deal with him very well.  All this progress actually occurred over one month!
I love Math Genie.  It is fun and has really helped me get better at math and feel comfortable doing math problems in my head.  The teachers are all very nice.
My child's instructor is a truly fantastic teacher who inspires my child. She relates very well to her students and is extremely dedicated and passionate in helping her students to success.

We look forward to more rewarding experiences! Keep up the great work Math Genie!
Both of my daughters really love Math Genie. It has really improved their math skills and given them confidence in their math skills.  They are always excited to go--the teachers are great and they learn while enjoying the classes.
My kid has developed an exceptional skill with Math.
"In third grade, I was a C student. Once I entered Math Genie my grades improved. I am now a 7th grader, a Math Genie graduate, and a straight A student.

I also play ice hockey. I have found that I can comprehend the game faster and be where I need to be. Math Genie, overall has made me think faster and smarter."
"My son is 8 years old, and we as a parent are very prod of our decision of associating him with Match Genie. Math Genie has given him confidence, & knowledge to excel in class. Very good teachers, and good methodology to teach kids..  “EAST BRUNSWICK location rocks” KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK !!!

ON his own words ""My experience with Match Genie is, was and will be great! Without it, I would not be able to do such a great math, “MATH GENNIE makes math fun”"
Best decision we ever made was putting our kids in Math Genie. My kids were able to get the hands-on method and really excelled because of it! Thanks so much!
Thank you so much for all your help! Our kids love math because Math Genie has made it so much easier for them. They can do calculations in their heads... and sometimes faster than I can!
Great program!!! My daughter has been attending Math & Reading genie for a little over 2years and she loves it!! She always looks forward to her weekly classes. Thankfully for the math reading staff for making learning fun and easy!! Thank you!!!
"Our beautiful, creative and kind daughter has always struggled with Math.  The school system said she was MG but her confidence wasn't.  After only two months at Math Genie, her attitude and abilities have completely changed from ""i can't do this"" to ""I GOT THIS"".  She actually wants to go every week, even in the summer, and feels so accomplished and successful.  We attended another popular school in the area and after 6 months and $7000 we got nowhere.  We are so thankful our friends recommended Math Genie.  It has made such a difference."
Very happy and satisfied with Staffs and Teachers and my daughters improvement
"My both kids go to Math Genie and I am very satisfied. My 9 years old kid's English and Math improved a lot. His both English and Math teacher are excellent. My son says he just loves his Math & Reading Genie classes.

I joined my 4 year old just a month ago and I really see him picked up his alphabets and number so quickly. I did not expect it will be that quick."
"Math genie, helps in math a lot. It is really helpful. In math you would be really good in math at school. You would be surprised about the impact it does on you. It takes some hard work but the teachers really help you out on it. You can get through levels really quick and you will love it there. We play many games to review our skills. And lots more.Everyone will love it."
"TO ALL PROSPECTIVE MATH GENIE EAST BRUNSWICK JOB APPLICANTS: DO NOT APPLY TO THIS LOCATION, OR ANY OF THE OTHERS.

I recently applied for the English Language Arts teacher/tutor job position, and the company disregarded my application in the pre-screening stage. This was incomprehensible to me, because I met the qualifications/requirements listed below (NOTE: I retrieved them from one of their job postings on the Indeed job search website, on an url address that ironically is not part of their main website, and a reply e-mail from the administrator regarding qualifications for a teaching position verbatim):

""We are looking for people with teaching or tutoring experience who would love to work with students.

In order to be considered for this position, you must:

- love working with kids
- be energetic! After all, you will be working with young children!
- have a positive attitude
- understand the rules of grammar
- have good time management skills
- arrive for your classes consistently and promptly
- be very task-oriented""

""The only two things we require is for you to be above the high school level and have the government authorization to work. Please forward us your resume and we will set up an interview. Thanks!"" - Administrator of Math Genie East Brunswick

Here, she did not specify submitting the resume either by postal mail or e-mail. Furthermore, after submitting my resume by postal mail, she and Math Genie never gave any kind of response to my e-mail, which indicated a lack of professionalism.

The most disturbing part of this rejection was that they disregarded an Asian-American, newly CELTA qualified, learning disabled applicant.

Three additional things to keep in mind for those of you who still want to apply to this company despite the aforementioned (NOTE: They are NOT intended to be racist and/or derogatory. Instead, they are truths that Google, the director, and assistant director/administrator are preventing prospective job applicants from knowing.):

1.) Math Genie IS an imitation of Aloha Mind Math East Brunswick, because it supplement teaches math using the abacus, as well as reading and writing.

2.) If you are of Indian descent, then you have a 99% chance of obtaining a teaching/tutoring job with this company (NOTE: The director and assistant director/administrator of Math Genie East Brunswick are of Indian descent). On the other hand, if you are not, then the director will not pay attention to your job application. Nonetheless, do not bother applying, even if you meet their minimum qualifications/requirements.

3.) Similarly, if you are of non-Indian descent, gifted and talented, and not learning disabled, then you have a 99% chance of getting a teaching/tutoring position with this company.

If you do a thorough research, you will be able to verify what I said, and therefore they can not be disputed.

The company is NOT an equal opportunity employer regardless of its location. THE TRUTH HURTS."
"Initially, I enrolled my 7 year old son in Math Genie to keep him abreast during the summer months.  Currently, for his 3rd grade fall school semester, he has received all 100s on given math tests including the extra points. He is excelling in math and I am so proud of him. The style of teaching has helped foster him in in quicker response times and increased accuracy and efficiency in his math calculations.  I highly recommend the program."
It enabled my Kid's analytical skills and thinking power. It is just not a repetitive math program. Teach is very knowledgable and helps my kid to  when required. Great and highly recommend it for all the kids.
"We have been going to Math Genie for quite a while and it has been great. My daughter has improved a lot in maths and she is able to work on math problems with ease.

She is very confident now and its helped her a lot in school as well.

I appreciate the teachers for all the efforts they put in every class."
"I am very pleased with the progress I am seeing from my daughter. She is enrolled in the reading program and loves it. The director immediately identified her learning style which helped me understand how I can assist her at home. Her teachers at (St. Barts) school are seeing a more focused, excited little girl who really enjoys reading.  This program has given her so much confidence....I really couldn't ask for more. Thank you Ms. Niralee for all that you have done and continue to do for my child and all of the children you teach.

Best,
Melissa Chonillo"
"This is the best place / program, if you are looking to teach Abacus Maths / English / Reading / Writing for your kids. Since joining my son was able to perform additions / subractions mentally and started reading words. Program is designed in such a way so that students can have fun in addition to learning. Teachers and staff are very friendly, co-operative, cordial and dedicated in all the aspects and give individual attention to kid's progress. I would definitely recommend Math genie to anyone for the betterment of kids."
Our daughter has been enrolled since August 2015. It was the best decision we made. It helped her start kindergarten with confidence.  Test scores in school are A's!
My son has been going here for reading class for nearly 3 years! We love it. The class has progressively improved his grades in language and arts classes. Mohit and staff are always helpful.
This is such a great program it has brought my daughters grades up in math and she is more confident than ever. She loves coming to class and the staff is so nice and helping questions answered emails returned. The price is very affordable better than any other program we ever tried. Highly recommend.
"My daughter has been going to both math and reading classes at Math Genie since she started the kindergarten. The reason is that I was worried that she was behind her class as I did not pay attention when she was in pre-K. Once my daughter started the classes at the math genie, I can see her improvement, especially in the reading. She has been in reading classes (which covers various topics such as phonics, spelling, language art..etc) for 1.5 years now, and she exceeds of the read level that is expected in her grade. For math, she struggled with abacus a bit at first but now she is getting better at it. The core curriculum that is covered in math is also helpful. I am very happy about the results. Not only that, my daughter really enjoys the classes. The teachers and staffs are very friendly. I would recommend math genie to anyone."
"Math Genie has helped my daughter a lot in her school grades. Before Math Genie she was puzzled on every problem she had, but after Math Genie she can do everything on her own without our help. The teachers encourage to make kids do more. Teachers and staff are excellent in this surveillance . Thanks Math Genie for improving my daughter's skills."
"I have nothing, but great things to say about math Genie.  Their staff is outstanding _ they really care about your child education.  My son's teacher Ms. Magam makes sure she come out after every class to explain what they did that day and where your child stands.   This program has enable my child to learn math with ease and he is above his grade level in math.  I recommend this program to any parent that want to give their child an advantage in math above their grade level.

Andres and Debora Oquendo"

It is a great place. The teachers are wonderful and very knowledgeable. I recommend you take your children there for a great learning experience.
"Math genie is very helpful to my child because they give personal attention to my child
they point the draw backs and work on the issue where the child has a problem which helps the child's fluency in advanced math and its concepts .Abacus initially and eventually everything is done in the head.

My older child has graduated from this program and helps other kids by assisting Miss
Olga. My second child is in the process of graduating in 1 month,Its a long process
but looking back it is fruitful,in how important math is in our culture.

Highly recommend as a supplemental  program."

"My two children (a kindergartener and a third grader) have been going to Math Genie for 4 months now, and I'm very pleased with the results.  I've found that Math Genie is great for both remediation and enrichment.  In addition, the staff are friendly and supportive, and my children enjoy going there.  I know that my children's  understanding of number concepts and facility with mathematical operations have greatly increased in the short time that they have been going there.  I can't wait to see how much more their mathematical minds grow!"
"My first-grade daughter has been enrolled in Math Genie since October 2015.  She grasped the concepts very quickly, and I believe it has a lot to do with Math Genie being ""fun"" for her.  She is excited about learning, and is always excited to attend her weekly Math Genie class.  She has above average grades in math, and she is not intimidated by math.  Her math teacher is very energetic and patient and does a great job in combing the learning concepts with fun.  She gives the kids incentives and the kids appreciate and respond to her in a positive manner.

We will be moving to another town, and one of the first things I researched was if there was a Math Genie located near our new home--and I am happy to say there is!

I highly recommend Math Genie, especially for little ones who are just learning--it makes it even easier to learn."
Thank you very much Maths genie for you've done a great job with my son Aryaan. My son has started reading and writing which was like impossible few months ago. thanks again.
"Our 6 yr old son has been participating in this program since he was 3 ½.  The teachers and staff are excellent, assist with any concerns and provide useful feedback. We’ve noticed a huge difference in his math and reading skills compared to his peers. He scored 97% on his gifted and talented exam for NY public school and is at the top of his Kindergarten class. The videos you may have seen of the kids performing complex calculations in their heads are true. My wife and I have to use a calculator to keep up with him or check his homework, which he enjoys doing independently!

Our 3 ½ yr old daughter just started the program about one month ago and already we see improvement in her number writing, attention and she is performing basic calculations on her abacus.  She told her brother this morning she wants to be a Math Genie just like him.

The program is great but you still have to support the children by assisting them with their homework and we perform 10 mental math problems every morning with breakfast.  (It takes about 5 min daily). We travel far from Staten Island and are big supporters of this program. The best part is the kids enjoy learning!"
My son has been attending Math Genie for about 4 months and we are pleased with the progress that he has made. The avacous they use in Math Genie is a great tool for the kids to learn math. The staff is great and the place is a great environment for the kids to learn. We are happy that we found a wonderful place that my son feels comfortable to attend and he love the teacher and staff.
My daughter was in 3rd grade when she joined this place.    She has been doing wonderful in math in school.  Math ginie has helped her bulid her confidence.  The teachers are awesome and supportive to the kids need. What I like the best is that they focus not only in abacus but also follow the core curriculum.   This year my daughter is graduating from the program and I couldn't be prouder.  I am glad I made her join this program.  My son is in kindergarten and I have already enrolled him in the math program.  This says it all!   Thank-you Math Ginie.  You guys made math fun and easy for our kids!!!
"The girls love it at math genie. They are always excited to go. The tutors there are extremely helpful and encouraging.  The girls are doing better in school, one gets a head start and the other has had improved grades due to math genie."
"Happy with MathGenie. Its been almost a year since my son started with Math Genie. Teachers do an awesome job in teaching kids mental math with Abacus system.

I have noticed big difference in my son, the way he's performing in school. Infant since I have enrolled him in MathGenie I don't have to constantly tell him practice math, finish your homework. He loves math and now does all his homework independently.

This week my son received 100% score in his Math for completing multiplication n divisions.

I would highly recommend Math Genie. I wish I had known about it earlier. But as they say ""Better late than never"" :-)"
Excellent teaching Practices and My kid has shown significant Progress ever since she joined Math Genie.  Great individual focus shown by teachers  towards kid's progress.

My older son already graduated from Math Genie a couple of years back.  I will definitely recommend this class."

You get to meet the teachers after each session discussing feedback and areas of improvement. My kids get more interested in math and reading as fun than learning. Well done Math Genie!
My daughter has made a remarkable improvement in reading and understanding math.  I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone. She loves going and everyone is very welcoming. If your on the fence don't be and do your kids a favor and sign them up you'll be very glad you did!
Rude.  Impersonal. Unprofessional.  That about sums it up.  Going with Braniac instead.
My daughter started Math Genie a few months ago and we are very happy with the way its been going. Each child gets an individual program and works at their own pace. The class is small and I feel like she is getting all the attention that she needs. I see advancements is her math skills and she is excited to go every time. It feels less like school and more like a fun weekend activity. Would highly recommend.
I enrolled my son in this program because he was struggling in math and after a few months his grades have gone from failing to All A's the school has even gave him the confidence to do better in other classes he is now on honor roll the staff his great and helpfull and after ever class they tell what your child has learned and where they need to practice I would recommend this program to anyone it has really prepared my son for high school

The staff are very helpful as well. I would recommend this program if your child is struggling in school.  Its a very fun environment for the kids, my daughter loves it."
My 9yr old daughter and 5yr old son both joined Reading Genie over 5months ago. Both have made great improvement. My daughter likes going to her Genie class and writes better writing scripts now. My son didn't know his letters when he joined and now is writing 3-4 letter words. Both their teachers are very good. They give feedback at the end of every class which helps them focus on the area they need improvement on. Definitely recommend to other parents.
All of the teachers are very nice and helpful. My daughter is enjoying and learning maths ssuperfast. We loved it.

Math genie has been nothing short of genie for my daughter . She has advanced in math and reading and I hope this positive trajectory continues .
I truly appreciate the staff and teachers for their cooperation and helping my daughter at her pace. We would definitely recommend the class as after all the research with different classes offering abacus I found this more child friendly making learning fun.
My daughter joined Math and Reading Genie over 6 months ago and have made great improvement.  She is 5 yr old and can already do a single digit addition and subtraction. She shows lot of interest in reading books and likes to try to spell words by herself.  As a parent I am very satisfied with the program so far and would highly recommend this place.

"Overall, the tutoring and feedback they provide afterwards is very good. My son was originally at JEI and I would say he has seen more improvement in school going to Math Genie compared to JEI. We are happy with the results we are seeing and will continue to send him here."
My experience with mathgenie is wonderful. My child has gone up in her learning. We are very pleased that we joined mathgenie . Will recommend it to other parents.

We've enrolled our daughter (Nitya, a second grader) in Math Genie Math and most recently in the Reading  as well. She's doing very well in Math and we're optimistic  in Reading too.

The staff members (North Brunswick location) are fantastic, always carries the smiley face and discusses the progress at the end of each class!!

Thankyou Math-Genie"

They being very approachable makes it very easy for me as a parent, to discuss any observations and they are extremely willing and happy to work with the child."
Excellent teaching for Abacus Technic..!! I realized my son and how he has improved past 1 yr..
Math genie has some of the best teachers who work really hard with the kids. They customize the program to make it work for your child and make every effort to help them with their weak areas. My daughter has been going there for almost 5 years now and I'm highly satisfied with their program and the faculty.
"Math genie has been a great resource for my son.  I have seen a tremendous improvement in his math and reading skills.  He is going to first grade and I can confidently say is ready and probably ahead of his school requirements.  Ms stephenie , his math teacher and Ms Roxy his reading teacher has been amazing and I definitely recommend their class."
Great experience with patient and caring teachers who encourage and challenge the kids to do their best work and grow their confidence.
Like all parents you want the best for your children & with Math Genie you'll find ur kids growing up with essential skills needed in math. Going great!

"my 4 year old son has been taking classes for about a year now... i am very impressed with his ability to perform addition and subtraction so easily! the teachers are great about incorporating movement during active rest breaks to keep his attention and interest. he is so excited to show me the new things he has learned in class and takes pride in being a ""math genie""!!"
Math Genie teaches a great way to learn math. My child has started loving math after going there. Addition and Subtraction is great fun using the abacus. Teachers are very helpful and encouraging. I would recommend it to all my friends.
"We have started going to Math Genie since last 8 weeks. Teachers are very professional and accommodating. After each session they come out and review with the parent about  child's performance. My son, who is 8 years old, has already started showing significant improvement in reading/ writing. He has become more responsible and diligent. Most importantly enjoys going to Math Genie immensely. All teachers are good, and they love what they do. Ms. Erin, Ms. Vivian and Ms. Stephanie teach my son on a regular basis and both I and my wife think highly of them. My son does total 4 hours of tutoring back to back and  so far has not complained a bit about long hours. They have options of one or two hour tutoring as well. We truly feel lucky to have found Math Genie and are excited to begin with school year."

My daughter enjoys class and has learned so much.
Math Genie has helped Monica succeed in school
My son enjoys about math class with Math-Genie. I would like to say thank Math-genie !
My son has been going to Math Genie for 2 years now. I have seen an improvement with his confident in math class at his school. He especially loves doing mental math! He has been placed in the high level math class and I believe Math Genie has played a role in it. Ms. Megyn is awesome!
My daughter has been enrolled in Math Genie for Maths & Reading for about 5 years now. Going to Math Genie instilled confidence in her and helped her improve with her weaker areas. The teachers & management are fully dedicated and responsive. They go the extra mile to address your concerns and make sure that kids enjoy learning. I am fully satisfied with the daughter’s progress & I am thankful to Math Genie for her achievements.

"Good program and well designed class room and home work, is the best part of Math Genie ! My son loves doing mental and we do see a great improvement with his maths skills. Miss Meghan is awesome !!"

"We registered at Mathegenie recently after visiting similar study centers.  The biggest plus is class duration which is of two hrs. This provides enough time for my son to get settled in class, understand and digest concepts. Immediate feedback after each class and quick resolution of queries is big plus. The study material is at par for both Reading Genie and Math Genie. Thanks team for great learning experience.

September 2017 Update

The Math Genie and Reading Genie program for my son going good. He continues his interest."
Excellent place for kids to learn. I strongly recommend.

He has scored 98 percentile in his Senior Genie 1 exam and has proceeded to Senior Genie 2 level in such a short span of time.

Also for common core, he is way ahead from his class curriculum.

All thanks to Mrs. Tricia for the efforts she has  put in.

"We have been attending Math Genie for the past few years and the experience has been amazing. The staff is beyond exceptional, from the teaching techniques down to how they interact with our kids. We have 3 children and have placed them all in classes at Math Genie. The confidence they have in school is amazing. They are well ahead of the curve when it comes to what is being taught in school, thanks to the great teaching at Math Genie. We highly recommend any parent, who wishes to give their kids a leg up and strong fundamental backing into today's education, do try this place. It's made a world of difference in our kids."
We are glad to see our son's progress in a very short time and his liking towards math is growing day by day.
they have a very good learning system and also a great books with pictures so it helps kids to enjoy more.
"My son and daughter going to math genie for about five months. Teachers  are there so nice and helpful.
I see improvements in my kids."
"My son has been attending Math Genie since he was about to turn five years old. He is currently in second grade and is academically above his grade level. Both his teachers and peers comment on his advanced math skills ability. Attending Math Genie has also provided him with a growth mindset of the importance of perseverance, challenges, and the implications of hard work. I plan on having him attend Math Genie until he ages out of the program. The teachers and staff are also incredibly friendly and flexible with his ever changing schedule. All of the teachers within the program have degrees in education, or, are even attending graduate school for education, counseling, or school psychology."
The teacher is really helpful. They understand the kid problem and focus on that.
We’ve had a great expiriance.  Our kids are very prepared and confident in their Math class.

"My kids are breezing thru school. Because of Math Genie, my kids are able to do more work in a fraction of the time!"
My son has learned a lot from them. Great teacher!
I am really impressed by this institute . The teachers are efficient and very cooperative . They analyse the students well since all the teachers are coming from teaching backgrounds  they understand your child's strengths and weaknesses.I would definitely recommend this place.
So far I only have great things to say about Math Genie. Both my children have learned so much since beginning these classes. My daughter was able to develop  a strong foundation of mathematics that will benefit her for the rest of her life. She is more secure about her skills and knowledge at school. The teachers only have wonderful things to say about her and her work ethic. My son is just starting but I can’t wait to see him improvement. He will be the true test of Math and Reading Genie. Having speech delays unfortunately set us back and I’m trying to get him up to par with the rest of his class mates.
Math Genie is awesome. Its been a couple of months since my daughter started the program and she has already begun double digit addition and subtraction. Ms. Meghan is a great teacher and always takes time to discuss about your kid's progress after class.
"The best investment for my son so far.  He likes it and I love it. It's a win win situation. The teachers are great and always open for feedback. Recently, he joins reading genie. He loves it even more. He can't wait to finish his homework and sometimes finishes them in class.
Updated: Well, everything about math genie are fantastic. The owners, the teachers, the staffs, and definitely the program. Really nothing to lose! You've gotta try it to see it. Still enroll my son after 4 years and now my daughter is starting to shine:)
2nd update: Now you can tell that I really love this place. I have nothing more to say. Still one of the best place to intrigue your child’s brain with its abacus program."
Both my kids are attending math genie and are both really improving a lot in their classes. The instructors are very open to the children reviewing school topics with them and I'm seeing quite an improvement. The classes are also very small so the children enjoy a lot of individual instruction from the instructor as well.
Our daughter loves math and reading. This program has accelerated her learning. She's comfortable and they  move at her pace. Our older son went there years ago. Its a great program and i would recommend it.
"My daughter goes for both Math and English. Its just been a couple of months that she has joined and since then i see improvement in her spellings and she has learned new things which she din't learn at school or home. Doing mental math with Abacus is a great skill but needs to be practiced daily,They also teach core curiculum in Math. I would strongly recommend Math genie for both English and Math Especially as learning new Skills helps improve Memory."
I highly recommend this program to anyone with children who are already gifted or struggling with math. Math becomes more concrete and fun with their multi-sensory approach. Both my children score exceptionally high on their NY gifted and talented exams. I believe participating in the Math Genie program set them up to do well on this exam and in the public school classroom. Both kids are addicted to learning. Thanks MG!
My kids like this class and learns number quickly. Thanks to her teacher for helpful and friendly to my daughter. Attention they give to each student  is really good and they stick to policy of max 5 kids per class. which is the best when compare to other institutes where we tried before coming to  MathGenie.
"Improvement in Confidence, Set higher goals and targets to achieve them.Thanks to the team!"
"Best place for kids to learn basic. When we took our kids to other centers for Math / Reading. We haven't find this much satisfaction and best part is the stick on 5 kids per class and making sure as the kids are in same group of their study level, no mix and match with different age group."
Great center
Math Genie helped us to keep our son motivated doing study. Progress tests at regular intervals help’s us to know progress of our son. Teachers are awesome and keep parents well informed. Thanks Math-Genie!!!

I was worried my 6-years-old could not focus in the class. Math Genie has kept my son interested in his Math classes and he doesn’t want to miss any of them. I especially like the Common Core books. He has attended Math Genie couple months and he is fast doing math but the word problems. Ms. Cassandra has noticed my son's weakness and hopefully to see more improvement of his reasoning in word problems.

5 Star. Teacher pay attention to individual students. I like the way the teachers give the feedback after the class. Very professional.

"Math genie is an excellent place for the kids. Wonderful teacher's and staff, my 7 year old son enjoys every class and always eager to come. He is going there since he was toddler and now he is has become genie of math. Highly recommended to start this from early age, this is the place that shows math becomes fun."
My kids love going to Math Genie.  The teachers are very friendly.... and kids love them.
"Really helped my son with math and reading. I like the homework part, it helps me to see his progress. Teachers are nice and patient."
Math genie is exactly what I was looking for my son!  He used to go to Kumon earlier and was getting tired of the repetitive learning style. He is in 2nd grade and the math & reading classes have tremendously helped him all around. He has straight A's in all subjects at school. Ms. Kavita and Ms. Mahalia are one of the best teachers at this location. Thank you Math Genie!

This is great place to learn and teachers have been par excellence in nuture the kids in right direction in English learning and reading.


Exelent experience
"When my daughter began attending classes in September with Miss Tiffany, she did not know her basic math facts, and did not like math at all because she thought she was lousy at it.  After about a month, I saw a big improvement in her confidence level, as well as her math grades.  Mid January, she was able to switch to a more advanced class with Miss Jenna, and I could not be happier."

Its a great program and I will definitely recommend it to anyone who wants their kids to perform better. Ms. Kim is a great teacher and always takes time to discuss about my kid's progress after each class. My kid enjoys the class.
Ms. Sadia is a wonderful instructor.
My daughter has been going to math genie for over 6 months and I am very happy with the results. They care a lot about their students and help make learning fun. The material is quite strong and the teachers are very good.
My kid loves going to Math Genie and I see that the teachers are genuine and very approachable.
Math Genie has been incredible in helping our son develop his math and problem solving skills. He’s gone to both the south plainfield and east brunswick centers and the teachers and staff have been great at both sites.  We highly recommend Math Genie!!
"I have been sending my daughter here for the past 2 years and ever since she has been getting better in math as well as writing and reading. The staff here is also very nice and helped my child with her weaknesses as well as her schoolwork. I would recommend this to people who children are struggling in school with there grades and just so they are always prepared with math, writing, and reading."
Great program... mathginne program excellent work and great teachers .. I can see my child improved in reading and writing and he loves  to go there. I also loves it . I like customer service also ...
"Math genie elevates the kid to the next level in a very short period of time. Ms. Cassandra has put her best efforts on my son, who has special needs and helped tremendously in improving his handwriting."
"My child has been going to Math Genie since he was 3 1/2. He is doing very well in school. He is 7 now. We have moved to Manhattan, he got admission in a top private school. He still comes for his math & reading class every weekend. Math Genie has helped him a lot."
Our kid has been able to cover things that he was lacking in school and that shows in his confidence as well as the grades in the school. The teacher emphasizes many aspects (e.g. handwriting) that are not a focus in school. In the end the extra work and practice (in addition to school work) is compensating for the lack of homework from school and giving the kid another chance to learn.
"My 8 year old daughter loves this place. I sent my daughter here for more than 2 years for reading and writing in English, She picked up a lot and is ahead of others . Her spellings and writing improved in English.
Thanks,
Chandrika"
"Teachers are experienced, encouraging and focused on curriculum."
"My daughter was not having any noticeable problems in school until the summer before she was about to begin second grade.  A few weeks before school started, I noticed that she lacked a strong foundation in terms of reading comprehension and math.  Although she read really well, she struggled to comprehend.

As expected, when school started, I got a letter stating that she needed help with basic skills.  Always wanting to do my part, I immediately searched the internet for tutoring services-making sure I avoided the big name places.  Math Genie caught my attention.

I filled out an on-line inquiry and was contacted the same evening.  I brought her in for assessments the same week.  Angela was great with sitting down and explaining to me her levels and a individualized path to success.

I love Math Genie because they start with basics that our current educational system overlooks.  I appreciate the small class sizes and materials used.  My daughter's confidence has increased and I can see academic improvements all around.  Additionally, the prices won't break the bank."
"My son started going to Math genie about 2 months ago and he has already learned so much.  When we first started, my son felt welcomed, as everyone was very friendly.  My son was quickly eager to start and still continues to show that eagerness to attend.  As a parent,  I love that they really know my son.  The class sizes are small enough for the teachers to spend one on one time with each child.   My child's teacher is very sweet.  My son loves her.  She allows him to be himself.  After each class, I get feedback on how he did and what he needs to work on.  After only attending for a short time, I already see progress in my son and his high interest in learning how to read and write.  This program will definitely move my child up ahead for school! I love the staff and highly recommend this program!"
great place to start early education. Nice staff and experienced teachers. i am happy to send my 6 year old son here.
"Two of my children take math classes with Ms.Sosnowski. She is patient, understanding, knowledgeable, and a great resource for our kids! We couldn't be happier with our teacher!!"
An enhancement for kids to learn and uplift their hidden skills. My son enjoys the classes

We are sending our Son and daughter to MathGenie from Feb 18. My son improved a lot in English and Math. I am able to see the difference in his studies before and now. He is trying to read on his own. Seeing the difference in his math too. My daughter is loving to do the home work on her own as the material is Good and innovative. The staff is very friendly and providing them the support. We are very happy with our decision for choosing MathGenie for my Kids. Thanks Staff and Management.
My kid is a third grader attending Reading and Writing here.He is improved in his academic.The teacher is very helpful to all kids.She review his performance at every  class at the end which is very good and she pays personal attention to all kids on their individual difficulty in subject.Great!The only concern is if they have more workbook for class work and homework that would be better.

My daughter enjoyed to go there weekly.
"My both kids (2nd grade) have been going to Math Genie for almost one year now for english class, and I see lot of improvement with their english reading and writing. The teachers are amazing here. I would definitely recommend  Math Genie to everyone."

"I certainly recommend Math Genie to other parents. My kid has shown significant improvements with her math and reading skills moreover i beleive every kid should learn to use the abacus tool. The teachers here are very professional, caring and really good at their job. Unlike other institutions, kids get more focused attention with a lower teacher to kid ratio and their curriculam for each grade is quite comprehensive."
My daughter goes to math gene reading program since 7 Months and I can see a great improvement in her  English  reading and writing . Becoz of this her Confidence is improving too . Thank you so much  Neha teacher and entire math gene team for ur hard work. I m very happy with math gene.

"My two kids join Math Genie recently for reading lessons, from the first day they liked the class,  and the teacher Niralee. She put every effort to analyze the skill gaps and focused on the topics to improve in the areas they need improvements. I noticed good improvement the way they write essays, mainly the approach and content within 2 months. Very satisfied with the results so far."
My son is going since 2 months. I m satisfied with his progress. His reading teacher is very nice. She is so friendly and motivated. I recommend math genie to everyone.
My oldest daughter is 11 and she started this program late compared to other children coming in at 5-6 years of age.  She has significantly improved with her basic math concepts that she was not grasping in school. It has only been 3 months! Her willingness to apply herself and not fight with me to get her homework done has made me proud and I am thankful for the employees at Math Genie and the concepts they teach. I’m confident that she will start middle school on the right foot.
"I like the individual attention provided by teachers in Math Genie, which was the reason for preferring Math Genie over other similar institutions."
"We were very impressed by the curriculum that Math Genie offered. Unlike competitors this program enables a child to learn and hone their math problem solving skills in a logical manner instead of repetitive techniques. Wonderful program and teachers!
Math Genie student success stories range from winning Math Bee competitions to getting accepted into Double Advance Math Programs and these are just couple of shining examples from many more to mention.
My 7 year old looks forward to the class every week.
Thanks to Ms.Niralee to have instilled that passion of Math in him, she has made a lasting impression as an excellent teacher and role model. We are already seeing a tremendous change in the way he is approaching numbers and handling mathematical operations. Highly recommended.
Look forward to their Code Genie programs!"
"My kid is really enjoying and interested learning basic Match with the Abacus, my kid improved a lot in Math. Thanks much Math gene team !!"

We are very fortunate to find math genie. Teachers and entire crew adding lots of value to my Son's academic progress.

I was very happy to see my 4 years old daughter making good start and progress on the math at Math Genie. It has nice classrooms and good teachers. Also the abacus is very helpful for my daughter to do the calculation visually and mentally.

We are pleased to see the progress of my child after going to Math Genie.
My children have been with this program almost 5 years. I love it
My son has been attending classes at Math Genie for the past 4 months - and I already know that it’s one of the best decisions I made in a while . He was very reluctant when it came to reading and had some basics to be straightened out . PAARC scores have also been better than before
My daughter has been going to math genie since July.  She has gradually improved her Language Art.   We are happy with the progress thus far

Very friendly with parents as well as kids. My kids just love Miss Cassandra. Will be continuing my kids with reading genie classes and can’t wait to see them read by them self.
All three of my kids attend Math Genie - East Brunswick and they love it. My youngest from the age of three and he has consistently been above grade level. His teacher told me last year that where he was academically at the beginning of the year is where he needed to be at the end of the year and he will tell you its because of math genie. I love the structure. I LOVE the teachers.  They are experience teachers using the program to enhance our kids learning. I truly appreciate the level of maturity and the guidance from them. They are genuinely interested in our kids academic success and motivate them to learn. Excellent program!
My 5 year old goes here for math & reading classes for last three months.  The teachers are well trained and approachable to identify and improve the area that needs attention for the child.
My daughter started Math Ginie a few month ago. She got very motivated to study harder and harder everyday. I am very happy to see her trying very hard with her own will and I really do appreciate Math Genie professional teaching.

My son start his math and reading class from JULY. We think it is good for him.
"Very limited options were given to us for choosing convenient time. When we decided to withdraw due to high fee for on core math and timing issues, we had a tough time trying to reach anyone from management or billing. For the mistake from their side, they made us pay one extra month citing contract reasons. Had a very bad experience.

To clarify the owner's response about staff reminding, a ticket was generated for my email regarding withdrawal request and the ticket was closed. None of the staff reached out to me or reminded me about the contract for more than a week. I called multiple times and no one called me back to confirm my withdrawal. Finally after a week  I was able to talk to someone at the front desk, then they told me about the withdrawal form and the contract."
My daughter joined 3 months back and I have seen improvement in her speed using the abacus and writing skills.
Ms Meghan is working well with my son in math.  So far he is doing well.  His reading and writing has improved tremendously with Ms Kim. I’m very happy with the coaching he is receiving at math genie.
"My daughter is doing reading genie for last 4 months and I have seen a tremendous improvement in her phonics understanding, Reading and writing skills.  She had a great teacher who understood exactly what my daughter needs and gave her the right coaching. As a parent , I love the feedback teacher gives after every class."
"When we  enrolled our daughter to Math Genie, we had concerns about her reading, shyness and many more as any other parents have with their first kid. But we are 100% satisfied with the improvement that my daughter has now shown. She is more active, participating in multiple activities and she started reading by her own. The teacher is very friendly with the kids. She interacts with the parents after each class and gives her feedback and areas and activities to focus for improvement. I highly recommend Math Genie and all the very best to the Math Genie team. You guys are really awesome....."
The way the reading teacher train the kids are really amazing. I can able to see the progress from my kid week on week.

"It is with great pleasure that I write this testimonial for Math Genie,North Brunswick location.We have joined our kid Rohan for Math and English classes.It is so happy to see Rohan performing well with Math and English lessons and I attribute much of this development to the way he is cared for and taught while at Math Genie, North Brunswick by Miss Monica and her staff. Everyday teacher will talk about what is done in the class, what needs to be done at home and where student excelled or need to improve. Teachers are easily accessible and there is no hierarchy to be followed.After i knew that my son is in safe hands now i don't worry too much about his studies.

Thank you Miss Monica and your staff has been extremely helpful.
I recommend Math Genie in the highest of terms."

My son has been going to Math Genie for several months now. Ms. Alesia is wonderful. He has showed great progress in his school work and a new love of learning to read.


"My son was struggling in school. He's in third grade and eight years old. We decided to give this place a try because of its close proximity to our home. We signed him up for both reading and math. Overall, he liked it.

I found the teachers to be very kind, respectful and positive to both parents and children. I liked the small class sizes and staff enthusiasm.

I saw a slight change in his development. I do think it helped him do his school math homework faster and he was able to read more challenging words. I think it's a good program and give it a try if you're considering it."
Ms. Vivian is terrific and my kids love attending Math Genie.

My son loves learning math at math genie !!  His confidence in math has grown and its his favorite subject at school.  All the teachers are very helpful and patient with the kids.
My Son started going to Math Genie this year 2019. In last 2 months I really see very fast pick on maths & English of my son. Teachers are really making very good efforts in teaching approach of maths problems and also sharing daily feedback of kids after class that really helpful. Overall approach and method of math Genie class are excellent. I would highly recommend other kids to join these classes.

"My sister went here for around 2 months. Her progress has been remarkable. Her touters are good and experienced in what they do. She went from being incredibly shy to being able to answer out loud and present. After going to different tutoring places, we believe that we are going to stick with Math Genie."

"My Daughter started going to Math Genie for English reading and writing since three months now,  I see some pick on English. Teachers sharing daily feedback of kids after class that really helpful. Overall approach of math Genie class are good. I would recommend other kids to join Math Genie."





My daughter has benefited from Math Genie and we could see a very good progress in her reading & writing. Teachers sharing feedback after class is really helpful. I would highly recommend other kids to join.

All of the staff are very professional and nice.  Both of my boys go to this Math Genie.  Both are doing well and they love their teachers.  I would definitely recommend this place.
"Our daughter now completes her math homework for school with more CONFIDENCE, speed and accuracy. In addition, her critical thinking skills have improved greatly. Miss Alesia is an excellent teacher who explains concepts clearly and efficiently (to our daughter and to us, so that we can assist at home to reinforce what she learns in class!), and pushes our daughter to her potential. Our daughter loves Math Genie and her teacher. Thank you and keep doing what you're doing!"


My daughter has improved a lot in math and is now very confident. She is more independent in doing her homework after starting at math genie.




Math genie makes math fun. It helps with school. My daughter got into gifted and talented program reading and math this year and last year. Awesome program I would recommend

"We are very happy my daugher is learning math with ease. Really impressed with Aparajitha's teaching.

Thank you."
Simply awesome!
Excellent teachers! I can see my kids progress week after week. Highly recommended for Math and English
My son has been going to EB math genie for 6 months now and it has been a good experience so far. Teachers r great with the curriculum.My son has gained a lot of confidence in math once he started classes here. Ms. Sarina has been great with answering queries and very flexible with timings too.
Math genie is fun and it makes my kids smarter and better at solving every day problems. The teachers are very knowledgeable and excellent at making kids understand the concepts. The best part that sets them apart from others is that they sit with the parents in reviewing the kids performance after each class. They are very professional and I would strongly recommend them for Math and Reading.

"My child had experienced some learning challenges and  I was looking for a program that can accommodate his needs and improve his academic skills. I myself read reviews of Math genie and got impressed and decide to check it out.  It’s been a month now and like the reviews i read I can only say good about this program. My son started the math and english classes at the basic level and he got the boost he needed and he is catching up gradually, which used to be an impossible task few months back .He is doing an excellent job in school .They been our lifesaver! I get daily feedback from wonderful staff right after the class. I would highly  recommend this program.I’m thankful for the wonderful experience we are getting at Math genie."

"We are so glad we enrolled our kids in Math Genie, the teacher are excellent and the feed back after class is very helpful to know what our kids are working on.
Just 3 months in and we see such great progress. Our only regret now is not enrolling them sooner."


It's a good place to learn with personal care and with less work presure and home work. I like this place.
Math genie is a very good tutoring area.you will never find a better tutoring place than math genie southplainfild
It is a good experience.
"Hi, My Daughter has been going to Math Genie and she has been showing the improvement year after year. I would thank Miss Cassandra, Mrs Kim, Ms Meghan, Ms Angela and Ms Angelica for their attentive method of teaching!. We like Math Genie hence continuing from last 3 years."
It had some echoing sounds in the meeting.Other than that it was good
"Online training is working well for us. Ms, kaitlin is helping my son well and personal touch is still achieved.

Great work Math Genie staff. kudos!!"
"During the recent COVID-19 health crisis, Math Genie classes were moved to an online mode from the traditional classroom setting. Initially, I was skeptical about the effectiveness of online classes through google meet especially as these are young kids learning new concepts and a traditional classroom set up has worked wonderfully for generations. But I was pleasantly surprised to see how my son has adapted to the online classes through google video chat and is finding them extremely effective. He is able to learn new concepts, show his work in the workbook to his teacher and also give online tests post book completion with equal ease as a classroom setup. I would like to thank Ms. Angela for enabling and facilitating this online learning program including receiving the study materials on time and Ms. Meghan for helping kids adapt to this new way of learning and for making the online learning equally effective and exciting as a traditional classroom learning."

Math genie is excellent. My son is going almost a year now .I am seeing big improvements in him.Even in the current situation the online classes they are giving is highly good and well organized. My son is really happy with the online classes.
"My kid joined in Math Genie more than 2 yrs ago and we are so happy to say that she is enjoying with both Math and Reading programs .Currently her teacher is Ms Meghan who is very nice and friendly. All the teachers Ms Angela, Ms Cassandra, Ms Kim , Ms Naina ........ are so attentive in teaching kids.
During this COVID-19 crisis time Math Genie provided very good quality online learning opportunity. We really appreciate whole Math Genie team."
"Being an highly impatient parent when teaching my kid, I felt like  I am not going in the right direction. Needed some support and I learnt about Kumon, Eye Level and few others ; however the reviews of Math genie attracted me  and I reached them. Well, It is the best decision I have made for my kid's academics. Work given to students make them excited, highly confident and at the right level. Teachers are amazingly patient, they appreciate, encourage, support both students and parents. Regular feedback on kids performance helps parents  to further motivate  kids. I had enrolled only for Language, I wanted to understand how things work here before I could jump on Math. I would say I have the confidence that Math Genie will make every student brighter and focused. Bring on the EMPOWERED kids!"

"Our Son goes to Math Genie at Morganville, NJ. They have excellent teachers and they have done a great job with the online classes as well.
We love Mrs. Cassandra.  We like the way she interacts with kids and makes learning fun."
"Being with math genie for over a year now . My 5 year old is doing amazing . Considering corona crisis , they have been doing online classes so kids don't fall behind . The transition to online  classes has been  very  smooth, great effort by teachers , and administrator."
"We have been using math genie for approximately 6 months now. During this time, we have seen significant progress and confidence in our child with respect to reading. The vocabulary skills have grown significantly and every week my child continues to be engaged and challenged.  Due to covid COVID19 we had to switch to online learning via Google meet but this hasn't stopped the progess. Weekly online courses are working just like the classroom. The children still get to see their teacher ask questions and speak with the parents at the end of class. My child is happy to have Kim Kaur as a teacher. She is doing a great job and I would definitely recommend math genie in East Brunswick to others."
It was a very good experience with Math Genie.I would recommend everyone to join your kids here.I saw a very good development in my child.Due to this pandemic they are teaching in online in a very well planned manner.
My daughter loves Miss Kaitlin . She is so good with students and knows how to teach them . She is very thorough in her teaching and always gives honest feedback to the parents .
Miss.Jessica is the best teacher we ever have in our reading class. Her methods of teaching is Great.
Miss Kaitlin you are an amazing and fun loving  reading teacher for my son Meelan. Thank you
"I am very impressed with the Math Genie South Plainfield team. Mrs. Kim (ELA) and Mrs. Meagan (math) are excellent. My daughter has them both and there is a level of patience and understanding that is deeply appreciated. I'm amazed that young scholars develop the skills to offer feedback to each other during sessions (especially in Mrs. Kim's class). There are strategies in place to help my daughter develop self-discipline. My daughter receives support in math, as she is a grade level behind. While I am not seeing my daughter's interest change in math or gains in her ability, I do believe having the Math Genie experience is better than not."
She improved my writing and my reading.She also improved my vocab and spelling so much.We thank you for improving Helena!!
Math genie helped our daughter get better in both math and ela. The teachers here are really nice and very friendly. It is very easy to reschedule the classes if needed. I would highly recommend this place.

Bryce has been enrolled at Math Genie South Plainfield since he was 4 years old and we've been very pleased with his development overall.  He seems to enjoy math and his love for math has translated to his school curriculum.   We are also please with his instructors at Math Genie.  Obviously the COVID pandemic has led to some unexpected changes in the program but I'm hoping he can return to the classroom setting soon.
"Our daughter is with Math Genie from two years. In the beginning she wasn't  really into Math, but we have to say that they certainly  made Math fun for her. As of today she is confident in her knowledge and she is progressing very well. As her parents, we think that Math Genie was a smart choice for our daughter and we are very happy with it."
"Good guidence from teacher miss. Sadia, report stundents strong areas and week areas to improve, prompt response from the managment, totally a value add for the kid. Thank You !"
"We have been with Math Genie for more then couple of years now, teachers are all good with kids and provide a good one-on-one instruction, we are happy that our daughter got selected for accelerated math program at school thanks to all the teachers who put in the extra effort to help her through it."
Math Genie has been amazing for our two boys. My youngest is currently in the program and is developing very good math skills. My oldest graduated a few years ago and continues to be a top student in math. Highly recommend the program!
Due to the current situation my kid has been learning via online medium. The change from physical class to virtual was handled very nicely by the teachers. We were communicated in a timely manner about the classes. It has been wonderful study environment for my kid. He takes both reading and math class in Math Genie. His teacher is Miss Meghan. She is very patient and her feedbacks regarding my child’s development is very helpful. It’s very easy to communicate with her regarding homework or other comments. I have found this virtual medium being more effective and easy given the situation.

"Its been few months I enrolled my daughter for Reading and i can definitely say its progressive.
She does the homework and always excited to go for the class with Ms Jessica. Teacher is very kind and patient enough to sit and teach them and that too especially with the remote classes we could witness that. Methods to teach the Writing/Reading/Phonics is also impressive. Have already referred Math Genie to some of our friends.."
Ms kaitlin is our daughter’s ELA teacher at reading genie. We have seen a dramatic improvement in her writing skills during this quarantine and we would really like to acknowledge this teacher.
"My son has been coached by Math Genie teacher Miss. Kim and we have been absolutely in admiration of how well she teaches him the art of writing. She helps him work through creative writing and also points out areas of improvement.
The team at this location is very professional and do work on your feedback which we have been very appreciative of.

Thanks Ms. Kim and everyone @ Math Genie East Brunswick"
"My daughter has been a student of math genie for a few years now and has strengthened her math skills and provided math enrichment in addition to the school curriculum math which is not as challenging for her. She has consistently achieved high scores on her standardized math tests as well. I am especially pleased with the quick and seamless transition to online classes due to COVID-19. It was implemented quickly and effectively without a major interruption to the students’ learning and provides a great alternate to face to face classes and a good opportunity to learning from the comfort of home. The teachers we had so far have been great as well; friendly, patient, knowledgeable and fun. I also recommend Kimberly D'Amato as a teacher. My daughter has had her and she is bright, very friendly, and is very good with children. Her teaching style is effective and is good at communicating challenging topics to students!"
Excellent teacher.Mrs.Kim encourages kids to go  extra mile.My daughter improved a lot.
"My son, Caleb, has been in South Plainfield math genie for years and still learning more as he grows. His reading class with Ms. Kim is excellent as his writing abilities gets better each time. Even with online classes, the progress hasn't stopped. He can easily write an essay with given prompt. Ms. Kim always strive to do her best to get the interest out of her students. And kudos to Ms. Angela as well. One of the best management person you can ever find. She's patient and understanding. It won't be a mistake to enroll at math genie"
Mrs.  Kim is an excellent teacher. She encourages the kids to go an extra mile.
We have been doing doing Reading Genie for over a year now. Overall a big improvement with my child's reading and writing. Recommended.
Our kid is being taught by Angela and she is very patient dealing with her. She gives constant feedback regarding the progress and suggest any improvements for my child to reach our next level. Anyone looking to enhance their kids skillset should seriously consider MathGenie. We recommend it 100%.

"Its been more than a year since I enrolled my son for Math & Reading. He has shown tremendous improvement these days. He is doing great in both Reading & Math. His writing skills and vocabulary has improved a lot. He loves to attend the classes and does his homework independently. I am so glad to see his progress. I was bit hesitant about taking up online classes initially, but Mathgenie is doing great in virtual classes, I really appreciate the efforts taken by the staff during the online classes. It is no less than the in-person classes. They give us proper feedback after class and also keep us updated about the homework through emails. I would definitely recommend Mathgenie to others and rate it as the best learning center for kids."

"We live in Fremont, California. I registered my both boys to Jersey based Math Genie three months back. All their classes are conducted online.  I can see the growing confidence in both of my boys. Their participation in school classes has increased significantly.
There are few things which I really liked about Math Genie:
1. Curriculum
2. Teachers are very involved with kids.
3. Feedback system"
"My kids are taking online classes from Math Genie. We are based out of California. Since the time kids started taking these classes, I can feel the confidence in both of them. The younger one is so ahead of his class that sometimes he complains of getting bored. Their participation in school classes has increased significantly. I really appreciate Math Genie and their teachers for their curriculum, involvement with kids and providing an honest and regular feedback to parents."
"I have tried many other tutoring places, and Math Genie is the best by far. I love how the tutors come out and speak with us after the child is done with their session so we are in the loop with our child’s progress. It is incredible how much my daughter has grown in two months thanks to math genie. Thanks to Ms. Kim and Ms. Meghan for my daughter’s progress."
"My Daughter is doing the reading program in math genie. She has improved a lot on writing skills like structure, transition and her ideas are expanding on the prompts. The teacher works with the students needs and is always ready to address any issues."
"My son Harshal has been going to Math Genie for last 2 years for Reading and Writing. He has shown great amount of improvement during this time. Currently due to Covid, the classes are online and her current teacher Mrs. Kim has been great in providing guidance and encouraging him to study and review his material. Math Genie Management are also great if we have to reschedule the class due to conflict."
Teachers are very good in giving the right feedback and encouraging the students. I am seeing good improvement in my daughter's writing.
My kid attends virtual classes for math and reading\writing  from South Plainfield MathGenie center. He is very comfortable in attending the virtual classes. His reading/writing teacher Ms Susan Pinon is very easy to communicate with. I have received timely feedback and other information regarding the course and my kids development regularly. I have seen good improvements in my kids reading and writing skills. It’s all thanks to Math Genie teachers.
Ms. Kaitlin is very great teacher who is helping my son to improvement successfully in reading and writing skills. Thank you for all your help my son really love and enjoy your class  ... You are the best !!


"My daughter’s math and cognitive skills continue to improve thanks to Math Genie.  Although the learning has been tough since it’s still virtual, Ms. Susie has done a phenomenal job keeping the students on track and articulating the content in a way that is engaging and easy for the kids to understand.  I appreciate her consistency and approach!"
Highly recommend. Ms. Susan Pinon is a wonderful teacher and my son always enjoys going to her classes and math genie.
My son has been taking reading and writing classes at math genie for over an year now. His teacher Ms.Susan works closely with him and has been very instrumental in developing his reading and writing skills. She is very attentive and helped him develop a habit of reading daily and gives appropriate feedback when needed. Ms.Susan communicates well with parents and provides relevant feedback after each class.  I see that my son is more confident now and see a huge improvement in both his reading and writing skills.

"I've been going back and forth for a week with the management with regards to starting my daughter. The last step was to fill out paperwork (never seen paperwork like this, but I was like ok no problem!). I had no issue with any of the charges or policy until I came across a certain subsection. It stated I MUST agree to my daughters picture being taken and potentially uploaded to the website. I thought, I'll just just tell them we're not ok with it. It shouldn't be too much of a big deal. No other educational facility, including schools, have such policy. For those of us working for certain companies, our kids pictures uploaded is discouraged for safety reasons. I had told Math Genie as such.

Ofcourse, they turned us down! This is only after I emailing 3 times, and attempted to call, twice.

I think my husband and I are just in shock because of the mismanagement. Luckily, we found a place called Mathnasium who seem to be more receptive to our needs (like no photo policy!). Our daughter has an appointment with them. They also seem to have excellent results (they fix homework and follow Singapore/Russian method).

Pricing-wise I was little confused about Math Genie. I was first told $195 for one subject which was fine (amounts to 2 hours per week). Then I was told $145 for a yearly subscription, plus $99 every year after that. I was ok with that too.

On the flipside, I asked Mathnasium for their pricing. They have no subscription fees and it's approximately $240 a month. You get around 15 classes per month.

If you can afford Mathnasium, I would say go to Mathnasium first. Unlike Math Genie, they allow you to take a free class. If that doesn't fit, then go to Math Genie.

It's a pity because I loved Ms Susie. Company management is the problem. I feel if I was going to have this much of a headache now, why waste my time??

Placing your kids in courses is not an easy task! Here is what most educated parents should be aware of: if YOU are educated, more than likely, your kids will do well. The extra courses facilitate our kids through the process but that is it.

The course doesn't make the child, the child makes the course. It's a family effort.

Anyways, I hope this helps for those who are still making up their decision.

Less of a headache is better!

**********

Update:

I wasn't able to post a reply to Math Genie's response so I'll post my additional remarks accordingly on here.

Whatever is said by the Math Genie representative is incorrect. I am also an attorney and I understand how things work. I was ok with an internal photo. That was NOT the issue. The issue was uploading, without my permission, on a *publicly accessible"" Math Genie site. In other words, i was told by Ms Susie that if she becomes a ""success story"" the company reserves the right to upload her picture. That was the ONLY thing I refused. Please do not twist my words.

I know the value of a teacher. I said ""I did not* have a problem with the money. I was not informed of the full payment amount until 3 phone calls in. Again, I credit Ms Susie for the clarification. Money was never the issue. The issue is mismanagement and late communication on the initial set up. And ofcourse, uploading something as simple as a photo.

While I appreciate your swift response on this forum, I would appreciated it more if someone *called* to let me know of why the company policy is in place. Again, there is *no* legal justification.

And again, with regards to a ""free class."" Taking one class as a means to see if a child fits does not take away business. It shows the company actually cares about the kids. Other highly successful educational institutions do the same. I was totally ok with a committed 4 months. I really don't understand where you are getting your information from. Are you mixing this up with another parent?

The teachers at Mathnasium are well trained. As I am sure is the same at Math Genie. The only difference is the mismanagement and policy at Math Genie.

I wish Math Genie all the best. Next time, please communicate in a more appropriate manner."

"The worst mistake I ever made is enrolling my brilliant kids in this horrible program at the Illinois location. The manager and the instructors are in their small mind need tutors for themselves. You don't have to make the same mistake I made please, re-think before you made a choice. Your kids future is more valuable than the penny this people are after. Add something to the money you already have and go somewhere else. Chip money will most times give you chip brains, and I don't think you need that for your kids."
Math Genie is doing great for my 2 kids and the teachers help with social behavior aspects along with education too.  They are always available to provide input on how you can help too with the progress of your child.
"Both my kids have been going to Math Genie from last one year. I have had nothing but amazing experience with Math Genie staff overall. Extremely satisfied. I wasnt very happy with one of the teacher initially and after talking to the administration, they quickly took action and changed the teacher. I am writing this review now specially to highlight the way they adopted online teaching amid the pandemic. My kids teachers are incredible. Ms. Susan, Ms. Kim, Ms. Kaitlin and Ms. Sarina. I do believe in in-person classes but I love the way their teaching continues through live session with the same teachers and is still as effective.  I have seen great improvements in my kids writing and math skills since joining Math Genie.  Highly suggest."

"My Daughter Siyaanshi has been attending the Mathgenie program since one year. Her teacher Angela Diaz is really amazing. She nurtures her students confidence and skills. She is really efficient in using the right tools and techniques to engage children in virtual math classes. My daughter is having a more confident approach towards her math lessons now and enjoys her Math. Also, I really love the various tips that she shares with parents towards the end of each class to help us nurture the math skills taught in the class."
"They are very difficult to deal with. They care much about their staff then the parents. They are  Very strict with their rules, unprofessional and nearly impossible people to deal with."
"My 6 yr old boy attends virtual class and he is being taught by Ms.Angela who is a great teacher.She knows how to get the work done by my little one.She is an awesome teacher.Ms.Angela's regular feedback and suggestion has helped him a lot.I would highly recommend Ms.Angela.

Thanks
Ganga"

Thank you Ms Naina and Ms Kim.  My daughter has shown a great improvement in reading and writing and all thanks to you.  Awesome support and help from the staff whether it is a query or make up or any extra curriculum support.  Ms Kim knows how to keep kids engaged and motivated. Ms Naina goes above and beyond to teach.
Susan Pinon was a great professional instructor to our son.  She is a very caring person and goes above and beyond to help her students.  Thank you for all the hard work that you did.

I am so grateful to have Ms. Susan as my daughter’s reading/writing tutor. She is very creative on how she engages with her students in class ( I have listened to her virtual classes). Ms. Susan is very passionate in her teaching and dedicated to her students to make sure they are progressing forward. My daughter has improved on her writing skills and continues to make progress because of Ms. Susan. Thank you for all that you do.
Ms. Susie is very nice and a great teacher! My son has improved in his writing skills. Highly recommend!
"my son has been with Mathgenie for over 2 years now and we have seen an improvement in his speed to do mental math, especially with addition. now he can do multiplication using the same addition strategy. Thanks to the teachers Ms. Stephanie and now Ms. Susan Pinon, both are wonderful. The teachers listen carefully to our concerns and address that immediately. Ms. Susan is especially very good in addressing our concerns and she took extra time to take additional assessments, beyond the regular ones and showed us where our kid is lacking  or where he is excelling making it easier for us to focus on those limitations. Thanks."
I am sending my son for English class.my son teacher name is Susan Pinon.she is teaching very good.Thank you
Math Genie and Reading Genie has been extremely helpful in building strong foundation for my daughter. I am extremely happy with her teacher Miss Niraali in providing her customized path for her growth and development. Extremely recommend her :)
Both of my kids have been joined for the reading programs over 4 months. Both have made great improvement in writing and reading skills. My kids are happy to have Ms. Niralee as a teacher.  She is doing a great job and I would definitely recommend Math Genie in East Brunswick to others.
My son is being with Ms.Niralee for reading genie. She is doing an amazing job and she is the best.She is doing an extraordinary job in handling kids and bring them up where they lag. We are very happy with her.
My son attending the reading classes and his school grades are improved since then . We thank the teacher Niralee Desai for her excellent teaching skills and her ability to understand kids psychology . Thank you again Niralee for all your time and attention you have given in my son's studies and you made such a difference in his attitude and grades.
"Our son has been part of Math Genie for the last couple of years and his English writing skills have greatly improved .With online classes , we have the opportunity to listen and see how the teacher works with the students . Ms.Niralee Desai takes time  and interest by giving individual attention to all students. She provides clear information to parents on what each child lacks and inputs to improve . She checks their homework before the next class so that she can provide inputs on what the student needs to get it corrected before the class begins. She provides instructions  to parents on concepts so that as a parent we can also understand and help our child to improve . Thank you Ms.Niralee Desai and Math Genie for helping our child grow into Success !!"
My son has been taking abacus class with Ms. Kaitlin and he loves her!  She is very patient and a great teacher.  I would highly recommend math genie.
"My son loves all the classes he attend, the point systems encourages them to learn more."





Great school! My 7 years old daughter loves going there. Her teacher is amazing. I’m noticing great improvement in my daughters math knowledge. We love  MathGenie!
"My son loves attending his Reading classes at Math Genie. Ms Niralee is the best reading teacher Every class she comes up with something new, she makes sure all the kids are participating during her classes. Even if it’s a group class she will give 1:1 attention to kids if needed. Her efforts have tremendously improved my son’s reading skills, retention skills & Off-course his confidence. Big thanks to Ms Niralee!
I'll definitely recommend her & Math Genie!"
"""Susan Pinon is so good with the kids. Also makes sure to reach out to parents for everything. I like how she goes extra step to make my Son focus in his work"""
"Miss Angela was exceptional in teaching kids, I see great improvement in my kids math skills."
"My daughter loves coming here.  Her tutor (Ashley) is a sweetheart and my daughter has learned a lot from her.  Great experience, great tutor and great results!"


Thank You Ms Angela for your exceptional ability to work on my daughter's reading skills. We have seen you take great care and patient enough to observe my daughter performance and point out her weak areas to improve. Your feedback from every class has helped her and handled very professionally via online medium. She misses you a lot...

Miss Ashley is a wonderful teacher. She helped my daughters learn all the concepts that were missed due to COVID related online school.

Ms. Kaitlin is a wonderful teacher and my daughter loves her class. Ms. Kaitlin helped my daughter a lot with her reading and writing skills. Thank you.

My daughter has been going to math-genie for over three years now. They have continued to provide excellent learning for kids during pandemic online and in-person. My daughter loves reading/writing with Ms Katlin in-person. They have strict  safety protocols in place.
"My son who's in grade 1 took math and english classes with Ms Ashley Kerrigan. She is very friendly, adjustable with schedules and gives regular feedback. Now my son is confident and his interest has picked up a lot. Kudos to her and Mathgenie."

Miss Ashley is very knowledge and wonderful teacher .My daughter loves going to her class for Math..

"Ms. Ashley is a great teacher. She is skillful, patient, and enthusiastic. I am glad to have her as my daughter's teacher. Thank you!"
Susan Piñon ( Ms. Susie) is an excellent teacher. She always makes sincere effort to understand each kids unique learning requirements and accordingly make sincere efforts to develop customized solutions. Her efforts makes the learning experience fun and kids enjoy it. Thank you Ms. Susie.
Miss Haven is a wonderful teacher and we are amazed at our child’s progress with the program.
Math genni classes are excellent.. they always accommodate with your schedule.. education is excellent too..
"Ms. Susie is excellent in handling kids and making teaching interesting for kids
Most importantly she shares the updates on time regarding  progress
We are very happy to have her as my kids math teacher"
Ms. Faith at the Marlboro office is EXTREMELY helpful and kind.  We love how everyone at each Math Genie location is so dedicated to ensure a positive experience for our son.
"My twins have been students of Math Genie since the beginning of the pandemic. I was nervous about them loosing skills taught in first grade while in the second during virtual schooling. One of my twins confidence level was so low in math I was nervous. But having Ms. Meghan as his teacher, not only did it build up his confidence level he even asked for a math book for Christmas! When my son went back to hybrid classes his math teacher was so impressed with his scores and is knowledge of math concepts she recorded a video and asked what I had done. All I said was, ""Math Genie."" I want to personally thank Ms. Meghan for working so patiently with my sons. The worries for my children falling behind have been put at ease. I will continue to keep Math Genie as part of my twins educational journey."

"My son is doing well in school, thanks to Math Genie."
My son has been attending Math Genie since he was in pre-k 4 and is now in 4th grade. My son is so confident doing math and is always looking to be challenged. I feel the program helps him stay one step a head of the curriculum at public school. I’m also always amazed how quickly he can do mental math. The staff at Math Genie are excellent. For the past year his teacher has been Ms. Kaishini and she is outstanding. Even with teaching remote my son  has excelled in her class. He always leaves at the end with a smile and looks forward to the next lesson. She is very patient with her students and takes the time to work with them if they need extra help. She also makes sure she finds ways to challenge her students while making it fun and engaging. We are very happy with the program.

My Son having great learning experience at Math Genie with Miss Taina. We can see him improvement as well. I think Math Genie is a great platform for building child future. 👍
"Math Genie is not even eligible for a single star. My daughter attended the class for an year and I don't see any progress. I have wasted money and time. Please find below my concerns.
1. there are three to four students in a class. that means each student will get 15mins time with the teacher. For each holiday, even though the class is not on a holiday, they take holiday. i.e. on an average teacher spends 45mins per month. So we are paying 140 dollars for 45 mins.
2. The teachers will change without any notice.
3. They say the teacher are qualified and it's not true. I felt the teachers are college students.
4. I informed in the first week of the  month that I will discontinue. They said I have to pay for next month also because I am late even after telling them the reason. They don't care about what you feel."


"Math Genie has been a saving grace.  My 9 year old struggles with reading/writing however,  there has been a major improvement due to Math Genie.  He enjoys going there and the teachers really care about the students and their progress! Ms.  Faith has been awesome!"
"Mark Vallaro encorages child attention by motivation, bringing outside articles and templates to build writing essay difficulties (word selection during essay practice), and showing interest in your child's activities and achievements."
"Excellent teachers! They uncovers my daughter's abilities to think and reason by observing, listening, and talking with her. Great materials for common core, abacus and reading/writing."
"Great program to help kids develop math skills, which will help them with the school material."
"They cancelled my class last minute, claim to pay 50% higher wages, force you to sign paperwork with erroneous charges and unfair cancellation policies.  Will not allow make ups.  If you want to do a make up you have to still continue paying.  I had 3 make ups remaining and none of the timings worked yet they kept charging me month after month.  When I complained about it, they tried to take me to court.

I would avoid at all costs.  There are way better programs out there.  The original staff and teachers were great, it has gone downhill since then.  They claim the abacus actually works, it actually confuses the kids in school and the common core curriculum."
Very  bad service. Not happy
My Son has enrolled for Reading and Math classes with Ms. Taina Cardona few months back. I see tremendous improvement on him. Ms. Taina is very good teacher having great teaching skills. She is very helping and always answering your questions by explaining in detail. In addition Ms. Ashley Kerrigan is very supportive and helping on all escalations immediately if you email her. I am glad that my child is in good hands. Thank you for everything. I am looking forward to see my child on top of learning ahead with your teaching support.
My son is having great learning experience at Math Genie. Ms Faith is a great guide and an excellent coach.
Our daughter Ashritha works with Ms Faith at Marlboro center. Ms faith has been very helpful in Ashritha to improve her writing skills tremendously. Her reading skills have also improved greatly during this time. Highly recommended!


My daughter started with Math Genie since she was 3 1/2 years old. We are very satisfied with her progress. Her math skills and knowledge is a few grade level higher than the current grade level she is in. She is currently in our school district’s Gifted and Talented Program. Thanks to all the staff of Math Genie. They are amazing.
"My 10 years old son loves going here. Ms. Haven is amazing. David has great improvement, what I can see from his school scores . Ms. Haven helps him with preparation for his important tests in the last year of elementary school. Thank you!"
Math genie & Mrs. Ali have helped my son with one on one reading help. He is very behind from having to do virtual school starting in kindergarten. Having them there to help reteach him things he missed has helped him become more confident to try harder during school.
Math Genie has been a beneficial education supplement program for my kids.  My kids like it.  The teachers are great.

Ms. Fatima is a responsible teacher.  She cares about her students.
"First of all, it's more affordable compared to others in the area. I just needed a tutor on select areas I thought he might need extra help on and didn't want to put him in a full-blown after-school program. They asked me what my concern areas were and did a complementary assessment to determine my son's needs and recommended classes and levels. Their hours are also flexible which make it easy to reschedule sessions as needed, given 24 hour notice is required.

Ms. Haven, who is the my son's ""full time"" teacher, understands his learning style and was able to tailor to his needs. We saw real improvements over the last several months. It's not a chore trying to get him to the center because he actually enjoys his time there. He gives positive feedback on other teachers as well when he has to make up his sessions on different days."

"I would like to acknowledge Ms. Ali for her outstanding effort in teaching my child. She follows through to make sure her student understands and retains the curriculum. My child has made a big improvement in her writing skills since Ms. Ali started teaching her. She has the tools to start a prompt with ease.  This is proven in her grades at school.

Ms. Ali communicates well with us parents through the parent portal feedback system. She also has the ability to foster positive interactions with the student which builds the student’s confidence. Ms. Ali is very effective in her teaching.
Thank you Math Genie for having great teachers like Ms. Ali."
Gianna goes to math genie once a week. She is placed in the reading program. She has learned so much! You can tell Ms. Faith loves her students and wants them to be successful with reading and writing skills. Ms.Faith takes the time during the conferences to discuss your child's strengths and weaknesses and in what ways we can benefit Gianna as a team. I am so happy she is placed in Ms.Faiths class.
"I am very happy to see how my 6 year old son is succeeding in Math at Math Genie. Miss Fatima Mir is dedicated, enthusiastic and passionate for her profession. My son loves Miss Fatima Mir, because she makes the complex material fun and easy to understand. Miss Fatima keeps my son’s attention through the session and it is worth to note that my son is on virtual learning, which makes it harder for kids of his age to keep up. However, Miss Fatima knows how to motivate, encourage and challenge without pushing the limits of the child. Since August of 2021 until now, there has been big growth in my son’s mental calculations skills and now he is practicing mental calculations with 2 digit numbers. Simply said, Math Genie is a great opportunity for kids’ academics and Miss Fatima Mir is fantastic at what she does!"

"We moved to Texas 1.5 years back, and since then we have been continuing virtual math genie  in both reading and math. They  have amazing and  hard working teachers who work with my kid for him to achieve excellence."
"Ms.Faith excellent with students, always positive and energetic"
"I’ve been doing Math Genie for my youngest daughter with Ms. Faith for less than a year but I have been awed by how quickly she has improved with her math and common core skills.  Ms. Faith is very engaging, patient and accommodating.  She has kept my 7 y/o interested and focused.  I’ve had my two other children do it as well 14 years ago.  I’ve asked both my kids( one in college and one in high school) if they found it helpful back when they were in it and they said that it helped them with their  math skills, abstract calculations and focus."


Ms. Meghan is one of the main reasons we go to Math Genie. She brings out the best in my child and she loves to go and learn. Ms. Meghan is positive and loves to teach.
"This place has been a Godsend!
Ms. Megan is awesome. She works with my son individually and caters to my son's needs. My son has learned, and he has progressed so much in the last 2+ years at Math Genie. I’m really impressed and would recommend it to everyone. It's a guarantee that you get what you pay for."
Ms. Fatima is an excellent teacher and caring about kids progress.
My son continues to thrive at Math Genie!  Faith is caring and knows my sons strengths and weaknesses like a book.  She also knows how to keep him motivated as he enjoys going to Math Genie every week without a complaint!
Mathgenie is great! My son has been in Mathgenie for few years now and it was the best decision that I have made.
Ms. Faith is AMAZING!!!! My daughter can not wait for Math Genie day :) Her energy and enthusiasm shows in every lesson with my daughter . I was previously at Kumon and I AM SO HAPPY we made the switch !!!

"I would like to take a moment and acknowledge Ms. Haven for her outstanding and effective teaching. Ever since Ms. Haven started teaching my child,  I have seen a lot of improvement and confidence in my child. Truly, it feels like she has some magic that unlocks a kid’s ability to understand and retain what has been taught to her. My child has been able to perform well in her exams and assessments not only at Math Genie but also at her school. This is proven in her grades at school.
Ms. Haven follows through her work to make sure her student understands and retains the curriculum she has taught her.
Ms Haven also collaborates well with parents and gives updates about the child’s progress.
Last but not least, Ms. Haven has the ability to foster positive interactions with her student which in turn builds the student’s confidence.
I appreciate you being my child’s teacher and thank you Math Genie for having great teachers like Ms. Haven."
"I was looking for an after school program for my 6 year old and i did not like Kumon's teaching method.  I came upon Genie Academy on Google and read excellent reviews and decided to give it a try.  I really  love the teaching method it's class room style and every child is given attention individually.  And if your child is struggling or having difficulty with any topic in school they will help them since they teach Common core too. And many times if my child came home with a comment on her assignment that she does not follow directions I took that sheet to Genie Academy to child's teacher and she made her understand in a way that is taught in school.

Ms Tania is an amazing teacher , she is the perfect example of how a teacher should be.  My daughter has shown a great improvement not only in what she is learning but on her overall personality."
"Ms Chantal is very patient and work with my song hard , help him to improve writing and reading. Work professionally."

"My son likes to attend math genie.
Mr. Kamran is my sons teacher. He is excellent teacher who is patient and eager to help.
He motivates students and encourages them to ask questions. I think that promotes faster learning."
We really appreciate all help and efforts of Ms Fatima in helping our daughter in Maths.
This center really awesome.I would like to appreciate and thank Mr.Faith for her continues support and mentoring my daughter.
Miss Fatima is great. Very nice teacher. Very approachable. Gives feedback! Very caring!
"Ms. Ali Blackburn takes significant time, dedication, and effort to teach both of my children phonics, reading & writing. She has helped them to build up their abilities a little more and the repetition reinforces what they learned in class. Their self-confidence has grown since last year, they know how to sound words, spell, read comprehension, elements of literature, and so on. Their confidence made it easier than them to do everything at school. It keeps them more engaged in school and allows them to enjoy the learning experience. The Math Genie curriculum is also better suited for multiple pages practices for homework strategies that they do on their own!"

Ms. Faith at Marlboro location is the best teacher. She’s very dedicated towards her job. She’s extremely kind and also makes sure to work on my kids weak areas. After every session she gives us a feedback too. My kid loves Ms. Faith. Highly recommend her. Thank you!
Austin is great. Very responsive and proactive. My daughter has been improving her grades in Maths
"At this Marlboro location and East Brunswick location, I met 2 wonderful teachers. One is coach Fatima and other is coach Faith. If you are reading it, then believe me both teachers should be applauded as much as possible. They are not only doing their job, but alongwith doing a favor to the struggling parents by elevating the moral and confidence level and bringing the joy of learning to students. I wish both of them good luck."
Miss Faith is a very good teacher. My daughter has improved her English and math skills under her guidance. I totally recommend math genie for kids Math  and English.
"We've been attending Math Genie (currently Genie Academy)  for a few years.  I was extremely happy to find out that they extended virtual classrooms past pandemic as it helps us to seamlessly  blend the program with the rest of our homeschooling curriculum.   I love how each student gets personal attention and is able to progress at their own pace. It allows stronger students to advance faster without being held back,  while the weaker students stay on the topic until they thoroughly familiarize themselves with it and don't fall behind like so often happens in public schools.  I would like to personally thank Ms. Naina, Ms. Susie, Ms. Fatima and Mr. Takuma for making this an amazing experience."


Ms Haven has been extremely motivating and has a focused approach with the kids. My son loves attending her classes. She gives timely feedback and knows her job well. Really appreciate her for giving a big homework packet for summer practice. Wish her all the best !!
Excellent Teachers!!!!  Excellent classroom setting!!!  Highly recommend Math Genie!!
An awesome tutor center for kids whether they need support for specific areas or overall on-going reinforcement. Mr. Takuma at East Brunswick is one of the best!
"My daughter is in Mathgenie since 3 years and I can see significant difference in study now she is ahead in class, definitely suggest to anyone who looking for great tutoring👍"


"The program and classes make Kumon a distant memory … this place actually works with students and in step with what is going well or what needs work. Kumon was utter garbage and a cash grab. The one negative is the building where this program is held… they should push the landlord to update the lighting, doors and institute a little upkeep… new clients may get turned off."


"Mr. Mark Vallaro is an excellent teacher! He works on weakness on your kid and improve academic grade level. He encourages students for developing of new ideas in learning style and help students to acquire new analytical tools such as critical thinking, communications and research."

Super good with kids




My daughter needed help with reading and Math Genie helped her by first assessing her skills. Then they focused on the areas that she needed help with. She improved and now she’s learning to spell as well. Highly recommended.


My son has always struggled with Math. Every time we sat down to do math homework he would instantly get anxiety. Since working with Mark at Math Genie my son has made huge progress in these past 4 months and has gained a lot of confidence with building his core understandings in Math every week. I can tell Mark is determined to help kids understand and master these skills! I would highly recommend this facility to anyone looking to get their child the extra help they need!
Excellent program that suits and aligns according to kids. Teachers identify kid's weaknesses and strengths and create a program that can help kids.

Miss Stephanie is a wonderful teacher and my daughter loves her maths class. She is 6yrs old and was 3yrs when she joined and she is doing amazing.Its a great program to enhance your kid analytical skills and help them learn math in fun way.Thank you for all your help my daughter really love and enjoy your class.. You are the best !!
Math and reading classes are the best. It helps my son with everything from math to reading to coding for a little.
Teachers are friendly and detailed...

"A tutor center that provides well-rounded support from teachers who take the time to understand individual kid's needs. Parents are kept informed of their kids progresses via daily report and periodic conferences. Also, it won't break your bank."


"I was afraid that my son will hate going to a tutor center, but he ended up loving it! He gets math tutoring and has been doing well so far. His tutor Haven has been amazing, goes above and beyond to make sure his schoolwork is easier. She sends us so much additional material that we can use at home. Overall very happy with this place"

"My son has been coming to Genie Academy for the past 7 months and, our experience has been great. He’s improved so much in areas he’s been struggling with and his confidence has grown tremendously. The teachers and rest of staff are very kind and patient, always willing to help with any scheduling problems that I’ve had and offer sound advice with ways to improve the overall experience. Will continue using this academy for a long while"
Genie helps a lot to my kids in improve their math skills and reading skills. I love it.
"Genie Academy is a very good Tutoring institution with  friendly and hard working Teachers that made huge difference in our son's academic performance/progress.
Mark & Kamran are very good teachers taking detailed oriented approach in tutoring students.
Happy with Overall Math Genie Academy."

My kids improved their grades at school and my daughter is now so good with the mental maths. You can tell her the year someone was born and she calculates the age in her head within seconds. She has advanced so farther than the 3rd grade she is currently in. I really love that I enrolled my kids in Maths Genie
We love Ms. Taina teaching techniques. Very friendly and efficient.
Very great school for your chicken to go to. My son has made huge progress with his reading. He’s very happy going to class and learning new things.
The academy in whole is pretty much great. The teachers and even administrative staff are really good and helpful. Very happy with my kid’s progress.
"Really pathetic management.

Just only behind your money. Once you tell them you don’t want your child to continue with them. They won’t reply your email or won’t call you.
Their own staff are saying their education system is not good. Why we are teaching this (abacuses class)

I have sent email for discounting on 19th April I got reply back on 3rd May. Since then no one called for my son “ is he coming or not how he is doing ??? Because they getting there money on time. NOW I have to wait whole another  month until 1st June.

They have really nice on boarding process. Because they will get your money right way. But cancellation process is like GYM membership, keep paying keep paying even if your kid don’t goes for classes.

Anyone need proof  I have all emails  from them."
"Can’t say enough about Mr. Kamran!  His patience with both of my boys is commendable.  My kids love his class. They are excited for learning. As a teacher he provides the perfect balance of discipline, fun, and excitement for a class. Both of my boys are far ahead of the curriculum in their school and feeling super confident.  I’m proud of the boys and very thankful for Mr. Kamran and Genie Academy."
"My daughter Siena has been with Genie Academy for the past three years, starting at 5 years of age learning Abacus and Common Core. The growth that Siena has shown in these years is nothing short of phenomenal. First, the abacus program itself is unique where the focus is on visualization of math problems, as opposed to the same tired methods of solving problems that you would see in other math enrichment classes. This game changing view of looking at solving math problems gives kids an edge that goes beyond math. It improves their focus, concentration and problem solving skills.
Secondly,  Genie Academy’s curriculum for Abacus and Common Core is best in class. The different levels are challenging but not overwhelming and lead the kids gradually and steadily into complex solving  problem.
And lastly, the thing that sets apart Genie Academy is the caliber of the teachers. They are not only great at their subjects but they are also great teachers, with magical reserves of patience and ability to get through to the kids.
Siena has had lessons with Ms Meghan, Ms Stephanie and Ms Shweta and she has loved all her teachers. They have been kind, fun, challenging and have made her “math classes” something that she looks forward to every week.
Thanks to Genie Academy, the “school” math has been a breeze for Siena, and as a mom, I am very grateful to the Academy all the teachers."

"My son loves Genie Academy. His mental calculation has improved dramatically. Ms. Fatima does fantastic job knowing how to approach a child to help the child to understand the hard concepts of math. In addition, Ms. Fatima is always so accommodating to insure child’s progress and success. Ms. Fatima loves what she does and her dedication and passion for her profession is reflected through her work."
Genie Academy is totally worth it! In the past few months I have seen improvement in my kids reading! Thank you !

"It’s an amazing experience, teachers are excellent. They strengthen children’s belief in themselves as well help them have a success mindset"

I can see my kid progress and interest about the subject after joining Math genie. Staffs are very supportive and helpful.
"My own experience is very good. Personally I m satisfied with Miss Swetha’s work with Sohan , he never complains about anything regarding study as well as class , So I m very much satisfied with Math Genie academy and I prefer to tell many more parents about math genie tutoring.thank you"
"Great way to have kids learn math and do great with study and other qualities of life at the beginning of the age. Thanks, Genie Academy and Kamran Ahmed. Much appreciated."
Austin Beaulieu is a phenomenal teacher . I love his patience an how he does not mine going above a beyond for his students .
"I'm very grateful and thankful to amazing Math genie teacher (Mr. kamran) and the staffs at Math genie South Plainfield.
My both kids have been successful and passionate in Mathematics because of the teaching, guidance & the support they get from Math genie. I'm so pleased of what my boys are doing at Math genie. They're not only learning math beyond their grade levels, but also building up their confidence, independence & accountability. Really appreciate all the support.

I would highly recommend Math genie to all parents to build a strong & solid foundation for your children's academic development. You guys are awesome and our children's real heroes 🦸‍♂️ :)"
My son joined Math and Reading Genie over 6 months ago and I have seen great improvement. He is 5 yr old and he already can do a single digit addition and subtraction with multiple digit. He likes to try to spell words by himself and try to make sound which guide him to spell the three letter words. As a parent I am very satisfied with the program so far and would highly recommend this place to all. Thank you to the amazing teacher (Mr Kamran) and the staff at Math genie South Plainfield location.
Teachers at this center are doing a great job in improving the Kids knowledge and we are already seeing the results in their progress in school.  👍


I have seen a lot of improvement in my daughter. Teachers and staffs are very supportive and prompt in response. My kindergarten daughter has started writing and reading words independently.Definitely recommend parents to enroll their kids in Genie to see improvement in their academics.
Very unsatisfied
"Had very bad experience. After spending two years paying for my daughter’s tutoring, they switched the teacher three different times. My daughter does not feel comfortable going anymore, so I tried to reach out and pull her out of the program, but they gave me a hard time saying that I need to pay for another 6 weeks. I have them a two week notice before trying to pull her out, but they would not budge with the 6-week payment. They care about money more than a consistent and quality education."
