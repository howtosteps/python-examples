"I have looked into other popular math programs out there before deciding on Math Genie. What sets them apart is that their approach to learning math is both practical and fun. It encourages analytical thinking and develops problem solving skills. Math Genie helps their students become more focused in classwork and be more responsible with homework.

My son Joshua benefited tremendously from the program. He is in the Advanced Math class in his school and I'm sure Math Genie helped him achieve that. My other son Matthew just started with the program. I'm confident that it's just a matter of time that he will follow in his brother's footsteps, with the help of the wonderful teachers at Math Genie.",looked popular math programs deciding math genie sets apart approach learning math practical fun encourages analytical thinking develops problem solving skills math genie helps students become focused classwork responsible homework son joshua benefited tremendously program advanced math class school sure math genie helped achieve son matthew started program confident matter time follow brother footsteps help wonderful teachers math genie,Positive

"Our 7 yr old daughter has been attending Math Genie in East Brunswick for over 9 months now.  It all started one day when she told me that she that other classmates where better than her at math.  I had heard about Math Genie before and decided to enroll her.  We are amazed at the high level of sustained enthusiasm our daughter has developed in learning mental math.  The teachers do an awesome job in presenting mental math with the Abacus system.  One thing I appreciate is the individual pace that each student progresses in.  If the student struggles in any area the teacher will reinforce the lesson in HW and the next lesson repeatedly until the concept is learned,  I also appreciate quick ""after class"" feedback that the teacher shares with each parent.  It helps parents know what areas the child needs help in to focus during the week.",7 yr old daughter attending math genie east brunswick 9 months started one day told classmates better math heard math genie decided enroll amazed high level sustained enthusiasm daughter developed learning mental math teachers awesome job presenting mental math abacus system one thing appreciate individual pace student progresses student struggles area teacher reinforce lesson hw next lesson repeatedly concept learned also appreciate quick class feedback teacher shares parent helps parents know areas child needs help focus week,Positive

"TO ALL PROSPECTIVE MATH GENIE EAST BRUNSWICK JOB APPLICANTS: DO NOT APPLY TO THIS LOCATION, OR ANY OF THE OTHERS.

I recently applied for the English Language Arts teacher/tutor job position, and the company disregarded my application in the pre-screening stage. This was incomprehensible to me, because I met the qualifications/requirements listed below (NOTE: I retrieved them from one of their job postings on the Indeed job search website, on an url address that ironically is not part of their main website, and a reply e-mail from the administrator regarding qualifications for a teaching position verbatim):

""We are looking for people with teaching or tutoring experience who would love to work with students.

In order to be considered for this position, you must:

- love working with kids
- be energetic! After all, you will be working with young children!
- have a positive attitude
- understand the rules of grammar
- have good time management skills
- arrive for your classes consistently and promptly
- be very task-oriented""

""The only two things we require is for you to be above the high school level and have the government authorization to work. Please forward us your resume and we will set up an interview. Thanks!"" - Administrator of Math Genie East Brunswick

Here, she did not specify submitting the resume either by postal mail or e-mail. Furthermore, after submitting my resume by postal mail, she and Math Genie never gave any kind of response to my e-mail, which indicated a lack of professionalism.

The most disturbing part of this rejection was that they disregarded an Asian-American, newly CELTA qualified, learning disabled applicant.

Three additional things to keep in mind for those of you who still want to apply to this company despite the aforementioned (NOTE: They are NOT intended to be racist and/or derogatory. Instead, they are truths that Google, the director, and assistant director/administrator are preventing prospective job applicants from knowing.):

1.) Math Genie IS an imitation of Aloha Mind Math East Brunswick, because it supplement teaches math using the abacus, as well as reading and writing.

2.) If you are of Indian descent, then you have a 99% chance of obtaining a teaching/tutoring job with this company (NOTE: The director and assistant director/administrator of Math Genie East Brunswick are of Indian descent). On the other hand, if you are not, then the director will not pay attention to your job application. Nonetheless, do not bother applying, even if you meet their minimum qualifications/requirements.

3.) Similarly, if you are of non-Indian descent, gifted and talented, and not learning disabled, then you have a 99% chance of getting a teaching/tutoring position with this company.

If you do a thorough research, you will be able to verify what I said, and therefore they can not be disputed.

"My first-grade daughter has been enrolled in Math Genie since October 2015.  She grasped the concepts very quickly, and I believe it has a lot to do with Math Genie being ""fun"" for her.  She is excited about learning, and is always excited to attend her weekly Math Genie class.  She has above average grades in math, and she is not intimidated by math.  Her math teacher is very energetic and patient and does a great job in combing the learning concepts with fun.

"Our 6 yr old son has been participating in this program since he was 3 ½.  The teachers and staff are excellent, assist with any concerns and provide useful feedback. We’ve noticed a huge difference in his math and reading skills compared to his peers. He scored 97% on his gifted and talented exam for NY public school and is at the top of his Kindergarten class. The videos you may have seen of the kids performing complex calculations in their heads are true. My wife and I have to use a calculator to keep up with him or check his homework, which he enjoys doing independently!

Our 3 ½ yr old daughter just started the program about one month ago and already we see improvement in her number writing, attention and she is performing basic calculations on her abacus.  She told her brother this morning she wants to be a Math Genie just like him.

The program is great but you still have to support the children by assisting them with their homework and we perform 10 mental math problems every morning with breakfast.  (It takes about 5 min daily). We travel far from Staten Island and are big supporters of this program. The best part is the kids enjoy learning!",6 yr old son participating program since 3 ½ teachers staff excellent assist concerns provide useful feedback noticed huge difference math reading skills compared peers scored 97 gifted talented exam ny public school top kindergarten class videos may seen kids performing complex calculations heads true wife use calculator keep check homework enjoys independently 3 ½ yr old daughter started program one month ago already see improvement number writing attention performing basic calculations abacus told brother morning wants math genie like program great still support children assisting homework perform 10 mental math problems every morning breakfast takes 5 min daily travel far staten island big supporters program best part kids enjoy learning,Positive

"My daughter was not having any noticeable problems in school until the summer before she was about to begin second grade.  A few weeks before school started, I noticed that she lacked a strong foundation in terms of reading comprehension and math.  Although she read really well, she struggled to comprehend.

As expected, when school started, I got a letter stating that she needed help with basic skills.  Always wanting to do my part, I immediately searched the internet for tutoring services-making sure I avoided the big name places.  Math Genie caught my attention.

I filled out an on-line inquiry and was contacted the same evening.  I brought her in for assessments the same week.  Angela was great with sitting down and explaining to me her levels and a individualized path to success.

I love Math Genie because they start with basics that our current educational system overlooks.  I appreciate the small class sizes and materials used.

"I've been going back and forth for a week with the management with regards to starting my daughter. The last step was to fill out paperwork (never seen paperwork like this, but I was like ok no problem!). I had no issue with any of the charges or policy until I came across a certain subsection. It stated I MUST agree to my daughters picture being taken and potentially uploaded to the website. I thought, I'll just just tell them we're not ok with it. It shouldn't be too much of a big deal. No other educational facility, including schools, have such policy. For those of us working for certain companies, our kids pictures uploaded is discouraged for safety reasons. I had told Math Genie as such.

Ofcourse, they turned us down! This is only after I emailing 3 times, and attempted to call, twice.

I think my husband and I are just in shock because of the mismanagement. Luckily, we found a place called Mathnasium who seem to be more receptive to our needs (like no photo policy!). Our daughter has an appointment with them. They also seem to have excellent results (they fix homework and follow Singapore/Russian method).

Pricing-wise I was little confused about Math Genie. I was first told $195 for one subject which was fine (amounts to 2 hours per week). Then I was told $145 for a yearly subscription, plus $99 every year after that. I was ok with that too.

On the flipside, I asked Mathnasium for their pricing. They have no subscription fees and it's approximately $240 a month. You get around 15 classes per month.

If you can afford Mathnasium, I would say go to Mathnasium first. Unlike Math Genie, they allow you to take a free class. If that doesn't fit, then go to Math Genie.

It's a pity because I loved Ms Susie. Company management is the problem. I feel if I was going to have this much of a headache now, why waste my time??

Placing your kids in courses is not an easy task! Here is what most educated parents should be aware of: if YOU are educated, more than likely, your kids will do well. The extra courses facilitate our kids through the process but that is it.

The course doesn't make the child, the child makes the course. It's a family effort.

Anyways, I hope this helps for those who are still making up their decision.

Less of a headache is better!

**********

Update:

I wasn't able to post a reply to Math Genie's response so I'll post my additional remarks accordingly on here.

Whatever is said by the Math Genie representative is incorrect. I am also an attorney and I understand how things work. I was ok with an internal photo. That was NOT the issue. The issue was uploading, without my permission, on a *publicly accessible"" Math Genie site. In other words, i was told by Ms Susie that if she becomes a ""success story"" the company reserves the right to upload her picture. That was the ONLY thing I refused. Please do not twist my words.

I know the value of a teacher. I said ""I did not* have a problem with the money. I was not informed of the full payment amount until 3 phone calls in. Again, I credit Ms Susie for the clarification. Money was never the issue. The issue is mismanagement and late communication on the initial set up. And ofcourse, uploading something as simple as a photo.

While I appreciate your swift response on this forum, I would appreciated it more if someone *called* to let me know of why the company policy is in place. Again, there is *no* legal justification.

And again, with regards to a ""free class."" Taking one class as a means to see if a child fits does not take away business. It shows the company actually cares about the kids. Other highly successful educational institutions do the same. I was totally ok with a committed 4 months. I really don't understand where you are getting your information from. Are you mixing this up with another parent?

The teachers at Mathnasium are well trained. As I am sure is the same at Math Genie. The only difference is the mismanagement and policy at Math Genie.

I wish Math Genie all the best. Next time, please communicate in a more appropriate manner.",going back forth week management regards starting daughter last step fill paperwork never seen paperwork like like ok problem issue charges policy came across certain subsection stated must agree daughters picture taken potentially uploaded website thought tell ok much big deal educational facility including schools policy us working certain companies kids pictures uploaded discouraged safety reasons told math genie ofcourse turned us emailing 3 times attempted call twice think husband shock mismanagement luckily found place called mathnasium seem receptive needs like photo policy daughter appointment also seem excellent results fix homework follow method little confused math genie first told 195 one subject fine amounts 2 hours per week told 145 yearly subscription plus 99 every year ok flipside asked mathnasium pricing subscription fees approximately 240 month get around 15 classes per month afford mathnasium would say go mathnasium first unlike math genie allow take free class fit go math genie pity loved ms susie company management problem feel going much headache waste time placing kids courses easy task educated parents aware educated likely kids well extra courses facilitate kids process course make child child makes course family effort anyways hope helps still making decision less headache better update able post reply math genie response post additional remarks accordingly whatever said math genie representative incorrect also attorney understand things work ok internal photo issue issue uploading without permission publicly accessible math genie site words told ms susie becomes success story company reserves right upload picture thing refused please twist words know value teacher said problem money informed full payment amount 3 phone calls credit ms susie clarification money never issue issue mismanagement late communication initial set ofcourse uploading something simple photo appreciate swift response forum would appreciated someone called let know company policy place legal justification regards free class taking one class means see child fits take away business shows company actually cares kids highly successful educational institutions totally ok committed 4 months really understand getting information mixing another parent teachers mathnasium well trained sure math genie difference mismanagement policy math genie wish math genie best next time please communicate appropriate manner,Positive

3. They say the teacher are qualified and it's not true. I felt the teachers are college students.

"I would like to take a moment and acknowledge Ms. Haven for her outstanding and effective teaching. Ever since Ms. Haven started teaching my child,  I have seen a lot of improvement and confidence in my child. Truly, it feels like she has some magic that unlocks a kid’s ability to understand and retain what has been taught to her. My child has been able to perform well in her exams and assessments not only at Math Genie but also at her school. This is proven in her grades at school.
Ms. Haven follows through her work to make sure her student understands and retains the curriculum she has taught her.
Ms Haven also collaborates well with parents and gives updates about the child’s progress.
Last but not least, Ms. Haven has the ability to foster positive interactions with her student which in turn builds the student’s confidence.

"I was looking for an after school program for my 6 year old and i did not like Kumon's teaching method.  I came upon Genie Academy on Google and read excellent reviews and decided to give it a try.  I really  love the teaching method it's class room style and every child is given attention individually.  And if your child is struggling or having difficulty with any topic in school they will help them since they teach Common core too. And many times if my child came home with a comment on her assignment that she does not follow directions I took that sheet to Genie Academy to child's teacher and she made her understand in a way that is taught in school.

Ms Tania is an amazing teacher , she is the perfect example of how a teacher should be.  My daughter has shown a great improvement not only in what she is learning but on her overall personality.",looking school program 6 year old like kumon teaching method came upon genie academy google read excellent reviews decided give try really love teaching method class room style every child given attention individually child struggling difficulty topic school help since teach common core many times child came home comment assignment follow directions took sheet genie academy child teacher made understand way taught school ms tania amazing teacher perfect example teacher daughter shown great improvement learning overall personality,Positive

"Ms. Ali Blackburn takes significant time, dedication, and effort to teach both of my children phonics, reading & writing. She has helped them to build up their abilities a little more and the repetition reinforces what they learned in class. Their self-confidence has grown since last year, they know how to sound words, spell, read comprehension, elements of literature, and so on. Their confidence made it easier than them to do everything at school. It keeps them more engaged in school and allows them to enjoy the learning experience. The Math Genie curriculum is also better suited for multiple pages practices for homework strategies that they do on their own!",ali blackburn takes significant time dedication effort teach children phonics reading writing helped build abilities little repetition reinforces learned class grown since last year know sound words spell read comprehension elements literature confidence made easier everything school keeps engaged school allows enjoy learning experience math genie curriculum also better suited multiple pages practices homework strategies,Positive

"We've been attending Math Genie (currently Genie Academy)  for a few years.  I was extremely happy to find out that they extended virtual classrooms past pandemic as it helps us to seamlessly  blend the program with the rest of our homeschooling curriculum.   I love how each student gets personal attention and is able to progress at their own pace. It allows stronger students to advance faster without being held back,  while the weaker students stay on the topic until they thoroughly familiarize themselves with it and don't fall behind like so often happens in public schools.  I would like to personally thank Ms. Naina, Ms. Susie, Ms. Fatima and Mr. Takuma for making this an amazing experience.",attending math genie currently genie academy years extremely happy find extended virtual classrooms past pandemic helps us seamlessly blend program rest homeschooling curriculum love student gets personal attention able progress pace allows stronger students advance faster without held back weaker students stay topic thoroughly familiarize fall behind like often happens public schools would like personally thank naina susie fatima takuma making amazing experience,Positive

"My daughter Siena has been with Genie Academy for the past three years, starting at 5 years of age learning Abacus and Common Core. The growth that Siena has shown in these years is nothing short of phenomenal. First, the abacus program itself is unique where the focus is on visualization of math problems, as opposed to the same tired methods of solving problems that you would see in other math enrichment classes. This game changing view of looking at solving math problems gives kids an edge that goes beyond math. It improves their focus, concentration and problem solving skills.
Secondly,  Genie Academy’s curriculum for Abacus and Common Core is best in class. The different levels are challenging but not overwhelming and lead the kids gradually and steadily into complex solving  problem.
And lastly, the thing that sets apart Genie Academy is the caliber of the teachers. They are not only great at their subjects but they are also great teachers, with magical reserves of patience and ability to get through to the kids.
Siena has had lessons with Ms Meghan, Ms Stephanie and Ms Shweta and she has loved all her teachers. They have been kind, fun, challenging and have made her “math classes” something that she looks forward to every week.
Thanks to Genie Academy, the “school” math has been a breeze for Siena, and as a mom, I am very grateful to the Academy all the teachers.",daughter siena genie academy past three years starting 5 years age learning abacus common core growth siena shown years nothing short phenomenal first abacus program unique focus visualization math problems opposed tired methods solving problems would see math enrichment classes game changing view looking solving math problems gives kids edge goes beyond math improves focus concentration problem solving skills secondly genie academy curriculum abacus common core best class different levels challenging overwhelming lead kids gradually steadily complex solving problem lastly thing sets apart genie academy caliber teachers great subjects also great teachers magical reserves patience ability get kids siena lessons ms meghan ms stephanie ms shweta loved teachers kind fun challenging made math classes something looks forward every week thanks genie academy school math breeze siena mom grateful academy teachers,Positive

"Had very bad experience. After spending two years paying for my daughter’s tutoring, they switched the teacher three different times. My daughter does not feel comfortable going anymore, so I tried to reach out and pull her out of the program, but they gave me a hard time saying that I need to pay for another 6 weeks. I have them a two week notice before trying to pull her out, but they would not budge with the 6-week payment.
